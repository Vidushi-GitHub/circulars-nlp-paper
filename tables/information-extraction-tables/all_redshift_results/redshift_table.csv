""On October 17.20 UT we observed  the possible host galaxy of the Fermi/LAT
GRB 091003 (McEnery at al, GCN 9985 and Perley et al. GCN 9997) with
Gemini GMOS-N.

We took a sequence of 2 spectra of 1800s each covering the 6000-10000A
wavelength range. The spectra clearly show emission lines which we 
interpreted
as [OII]3727, Hbeta and we resolved the [OIII]4959,5007 doublet.
All these identifications are consistent with redshift z = 0.8969 for 
this galaxy.

The galaxy is detected in our 300s R-band acquisition image.
The estimated magnitude, calibrated using 3 SDSS stars is:

R = 22.65 +- 0.05 mag

This value is brighter than the cataloged magnitude, which may indicate a
contribution of the afterglow. After subtracting the contribution
of the galaxy we derive an estimate of the OT flux, R = 23.65 +- 0.05 mag.

Swift XRT observed GRB 100316D (Stamatikos et al. 2010, GCN10496)
in Windowed Timing (WT) mode in the 144-737 s time interval.
During this interval the light curve decays very slowly (decay
index alpha=-0.13, Starling et al. 2010, GCN 10505).
In addition, the 1.5-10 keV to 0.3-1.5 keV hardness ratio remains
constant (reduced chi2=0.91 with 97 degrees of freedom, dof).
Motivated by the high count rate (around 30 c s^-1, but far from
the pile up limit) and by the constant spectral shape we tried to
estimate the GRB redshift from the X-ray data.
We assume a Galactic column density of 7x10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et
al. 2005, A&A 440 775) and fit the WT spectrum taken from the
Leicester pages (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/00416135/)
with an absorbed (phabs*zphabs) cutoff power law model (the cutoff
power law model provides much better results in terms of column
density evaluation with respect to a simple power law model when
small spectral variations are present). Given the high count rate
we selected single pixel events only.
The resulting fit is good (reduced chi2=1.2, 333 dof). The redshift
is constrained to lie within the 90% confidence level (delta
chi2=4.61) of 0.014<z<0.28 (with a best fit redshift of z=0.1 and
intrinsic column density of N_H(z)=7x10^21 cm^-2).
Filtering WT counts with grades 0-2 (standard WT grades) slightly
shifts the best fit range to larger redshifts (in the approximate
range 0.1-0.6).

Swift XRT observed GRB 100413A (Holland et al. 2010, GCN 10581)
in Windowed Timing (WT) mode in the 146-550 s time interval.
During this interval the 1.5-10 keV to 0.3-1.5 keV hardness ratio slightly
decayed, testifying for small spectral variations.
We assume a Galactic column density of 7.3x10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et
al. 2005, A&A 440 775) and fit the WT spectrum with an absorbed
(tbabs*ztbabs) cutoff power law model within XSPEC (the cutoff power
law model provides much better results in terms of column density 
evaluation
with respect to a simple power law model when small spectral variations 
are present).
Data were grouped to have 30 counts per spectral bin. The resulting fit 
is good
(reduced chi2=0.9, 194 dof).
Filtering the data for single pixel events does not change the results.
In the intrinsic column density vs. redshift plane there is a low 
significance (3 sigma)
solution at low redshifts but the minimum lies at higher redshifts with 
a 2 sigma confidence
level solution of z=3.9+1.7-0.7 and N_H(z)=(5.5+9.8-2.1)x1022 cm-2.
Thus, even if we cannot exclude that GRB100413A is at low redshift, a 
high redshift (z~4),
highly absorbed (N_H(z)~6x1022 cm-2) solution is preferred.
This compares well with the non-detection with UVOT (Holland et al.

other robotic telescopes.

Swift-XRT team:

Swift XRT observed the bright GRB 100704A (Grupe et al. 2010, GCN 10929)
starting 86 s after the BAT trigger. After strong X-ray flares the light 
curve started decaying
following a power law (Grupe 2010, GCN 10935).
We selected the time interval 4,510-28,896 s after the burst onset to 
collect the Photon
Counting (PC) spectrum. During this interval the spectrum is almost 
constant as testified by
a constant power law photon index (chi2=102 with 123 degrees of freedom).

We fit the PC spectrum (comprising 2002 counts) with a (Galactic plus 
intrinsic) absorbed
cutoff power-law model (tbabs*ztbabs*cutoff) within XSPEC (the cutoff 
power-law model
provides much better results in terms of column density evaluation with 
respect to a simple
power-law model when small spectral variations are present).
We assume a Galactic column density of 1.1x1021 cm-2 (Kalberla et al. 
2005, A&A 440 775)
and allowed for a 30% variability given its high value (and sampling all 
the values obtained
within 1 degree from the source).
We fit the spectrum using C-statistics. In the intrinsic column density 
vs. redshift plane there
is a low significance (3 sigma) solution at low redshifts but the 
minimum lies at higher redshifts
with a 2 sigma confidence level solution of z=3.6^+1.1 _-1.2 and N_H 
(z)=(9.7^+9.9 _-5.6 )x10^22 cm^-2 .
Thus, even if we cannot exclude that GRB100704A is at low redshift, a 
high redshift (z~3.5),
highly absorbed (N_H (z)~1x10^23 cm^-2 ) solution is preferred.
This compares well with the non-detection with UVOT (Kuin and Grupe 
2010, GCN 10934)
and MOA robotic telescope (Omori et al. 2010, GCN 10931).
We also note that if no interviening systems are present along the line 
of sight a 90% lower
limit on the metallicity of 0.03 solar can be set (based on the 
assumption that the absorbing
medium is not Thomson thick).

For GRB 100724A (Markwardt et al GCN 10968), the spectral lag analysis
of the mask-weighted data from T-0.5 sec to T+2 sec yields a lag
of 316 +/- 82 msec for the 25-50 to 50-100 keV bands using light
curve binning of 64 msec. This relatively large observed lag value
puts this burst in the long burst category.

The observed T90 (1.4 +/- 0.2 sec; Swift/BAT 15-350 keV,
Markwardt et al., GCN 10972) value is in the middle of the
the soft/long bimodal distribution. The power-law fit to the

and in the soft side tail of the Short GRB PLI distribution.

In summary, the observed T90 value for GRB 100724A is inconclusive.
The relatively large spectral lag value and soft spectrum points
towards long soft burst. Our conclusion is that this burst
is likely to be in the long burst category. Further observations

""We obtained a spectrum of the host galaxy of the proposed afterglow of 
GRB010921 (Price et al., GCN 1107) using the Double Spectrograph at the
Palomar 200-inch telescope, on 17 October 2001 UT.  Preliminary reductions
of the spectrum indicate a redshift of z = 0.450 +- 0.005, on the basis of 
4 emission lines, [O II] 3727, H-beta, [O III] 5007, and H-alpha.  The 
spectrum is typical for an actively star-forming galaxy, with no sign of 
an active nucleus.  Further analysis is in progress.

Assuming an H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m = 0.3, Omega_lambda = 0.7 cosmology,
we derive the luminosity distance of 8.30e+27 cm.  Using the fluence of 
1.0e-6 erg/cm2 (Ricker et al. GCN #1096), the total energy release in the 
restframe range 12-123 keV (redshifted bandpass of the HETE band at 8-85 keV) 
is 6.0e+50 erg.  Though no spectral information was reported, we estimate that 
the isotropic equivalent energy release in the 20-2000 keV range (see Bloom
et al. 2001, AJ, 121, 2879) was E_iso(gamma) = (2.65 +- 1.45)e+51 erg.

To conform with the constant energy of E_gamma = 5e+50 erg (Frail et al.
2001, ApJ Letters, accepted; astro-ph/0102282), the time of the jet break 
would be t_jet ~ 130 days after the GRB.  However, a possible supernova 
associated with this event may be detectable now.""

reported in Tanvir et al. (GCN 11109). The afterglow was centred in the

was also partially in the slit. The spectrum covers a wavelength range
from about 4000A to 6700A.

Our analysis of the galaxy trace provides a tentative detection of the OIII

we caution that all these features are low S/N. No other lines are clearly seen
even though OII 3727A would be within the spectral range (but we note the
galaxy continuum is not apparent below about 4700A, in part due to declining
detector quantum efficiency in the blue). Neither have we identified so far
any significant features in the afterglow spectrum.

This is a similar redshift to a number of Swift short-duration burst hosts,
but further observations are encouraged to confirm the result.

Swift BAT triggered on the early activity of GRB 100902A (Sakamoto et 
al. 2010, GCN 11181). Swift XRT started observing 316 s after the 
trigger observing the main event. By using the Swift/XRT spectrum 
repository at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/ (see Evans et al. 
2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177) we selected two time intervals with an almost 
constant hardness ratio. These are at the end of the main event between 
500-550 s (in Window Timing, WT, mode) and the entire first orbit in 
Photon Counting (PC) mode (between 600-3000 s). We then fit the two 
spectra with XSPEC using the model tbabs*ztbabs (cutoff), keeping the 
same absorption pattern and leaving free the cutoff power-law model for 
the two spectra (the cutoff power-law model provides much better results 
in terms of column density evaluation with respect to a simple power-law 
model when small spectral variations are present).
We assume a Galactic column density of 1.1x1021 cm-2 (Kalberla et al. 
2005, A&A 440 775) and we allow for a 30% uncertainty in the fit.  We 
fit the spectrum using C-statistics. In the intrinsic column density vs. 
redshift plane there is just one deep minimum hinting for a redshift 
z=4.5^+0.3_-0.2 (90% confidence level) and an intrinsic column density 
N_H(z)=(2.3^+0.5_-0.3)x1023 cm-2. The X-ray spectrum is very soft with 
Gamma~3.9 at the end of the prompt phase (with a cut-off energy >17 keV) 
and with Gamma~1.9 and E_cut~5 keV in the PC spectrum. The two spectra 
indicate the same redshift even separately.
The high redshift and the large absorbing column density are in line 
with the non-detection with UVOT and other ground based optical facilities.

UT (22 hr after the GRB). A total exposure of 4x600 s was obtained,
covering the spectral range from 300 to 2500 nm. Due to technical
problems with the atmospheric dispersion corrector, the sensitivity of
the instrument was below the nominal value during this observation so
the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is very low.

In the spectra we detect a broad absorption line consistent with a
damped Lyman-alpha line and absorption features consistent with the MgII

Swift BAT triggered on the early activity of GRB 101213A (Sakamoto et
al. 2010, GCN 11448). Swift XRT started observing 106 s after the
trigger observing the main event. We selected the time interval between
112-154 s during which the hardness ratio (as judged from the Swift/XRT
spectrum repository at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/00440285/ )
and the power law photon index (as judged from the Swift/XRT burst analyser
http://www.swift.ac.uk/burst_analyser/00440285/ ) are consistent
with a constant. We bin the spectrum to 30 counts per energy bin and
used the latest response matrices v012. The spectrum is in Windowed Timing
mode (WT) and contains about 6,000 counts. We fit the WT spectrum with 
XSPEC
using the model tbabs*ztbabs*(cutoff), (the cutoff power-law model provides
much better results in terms of column density evaluation with respect to a
simple power-law model when small spectral variations are present).
We assume a Galactic column density of 4.6x10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005, A&A 440 775). In the intrinsic column density vs.
redshift plane there is just one deep minimum hinting for a redshift
z=2.9^+0.2_-0.8 (90% confidence level) and an intrinsic column density
N_H(z)=(1.5^+0.7_-0.3)x10^23 cm^-2. The X-ray spectrum is soft with
Gamma~2.5 at the end of the prompt phase and no signs of spectral curvature
(cut-off energy > 30 keV).

The absorption pattern towards GRB 101213A is complicated by the galaxy
reported by Malesani & de Ugarte Postigo (2010, GCN 11449). We tried to fit
an extra absorption component fixed either to z=0.1 or z=0.5 (i.e. the two
possible photometric redshifts of the putative host galaxy observed in the
SDSS, z=0.10+/-0.07 and z=0.47+/-0.22, respectively), with basically no
effects on the overall results. This low-redshift component is not able
alone to account for the observed absorption pattern.

Looking at the burst analyser page (see above), we also note that there is
a mismatch in the BAT and XRT power law photon indices during the short
interval during which there are contemporanous data. Motivated by this we
fit the XRT spectrum with a broken power law.
The fit is as good as the power law fit. In this case we obtain a very soft
low-energy photon index of Gamma1=3.1+/-0.2 and a high-energy photon index
Gamma2=2.0+/-0.2 (consistent with the BAT extrapolation). The transition
energy is around 3 keV. In this case, the redshift is z=0.3^+0.4_-0.1 
and the
intrinsic column density is (1.1^+0.3_-0.2)x10^22 cm^-2. In this case the
redshift determination is consistent with the putative host galaxy but the
resulting X-ray spectrum is peculiar, with a spectral variation Delta 
Gamma~1
and a spectrum that remains (almost) constant for ~150 s, becoming even
softer later on.
Alternatively, the X-ray spectrum could be fit (equally well) with a black
body plus a power law component. In this case the redshift is 
z=0.3^+0.1_-0.2
and the intrinsic column density NH=(1.1^+0.3_-0.2)x10^22 cm^-2. The power
law is very soft with Gamma~3.3 and the black body (rest-frame) temperature
is high kT=2.3^+1.3_-0.5 keV. The black body radius is ~2x10^11 cm.
We note that the black body temperature is much higher than what is observed
in, e.g., GRB 060218 (kT~0.2 keV, Campana et al. 2006, Nat 442 1008) or
GRB 100316D (kT~0.1 keV, Starling et al. 2010, MNRAS in press).

We can conclude that in all cases, the X-ray afterglow flux is heavily
absorbed and this is in line with the non-detection with UVOT.
Given the presence of a candidate host galaxy within the XRT refined error
circle (Malesani & de Ugarte Postigo 2010), we cannot rule out a low
redshift solution, but in this case a peculiar X-ray spectrum is observed.",z=0.3^+0.1_-0.2,GRB 101213A,Swift,Spectroscopic

report on behalf of the Swift Team:

GRB 101225A was detected by Swift BAT as an image trigger (Racusin
al. 2010, GCN 11493). Swift XRT started observing 1383 s after the
trigger observing the main event. The afterglow is very bright and
the XRT remained in the Windowed Timing (WT) mode for two consecutive
orbits. Within each orbit the spectrum remain constant as judged from
the hardness ratio and from the power law photon index.
We extract the XRT spectra for each of the first two orbits, separately.
We then fit the two spectra within XSPEC using the model
tbabs * ztbabs * (cutoff), keeping the same absorption pattern and leaving
free the cutoff power-law model for the two spectra (the cutoff power-law
model provides much better results in terms of column density evaluation
with respect to a simple power-law model when small spectral variations
are present).
We assume a Galactic column density of 7.9x10^20 cm-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005, A&A 440 775) and we allow for a 30% uncertainty in the fit. We
binned the spectra to 50 counts per energy bin and used the latest (v12)
response matrix. The detection in the UVW2 filter by UVOT (Siegel &
Racusin 2010, GCN 11499) constrains the redshift to be <1.4.
The fit with the cutoff power-law is relatively good with a reduced
chi^2 of 1.13 (508 dof).
Motivated by the similarities with GRB 060218 (extremely long duration,
soft prompt-emission spectrum, bright smoothly decaying X-ray afterglow
light curve, UV detection with optical non-detection), we fit the X-ray
spectrum including a blackbody component.
The fit improves considerably (and the cutoff energy goes well above the
XRT energy band, becoming unimportant for both spectra).
The new fit provides a reduced chi^2 of 1.07 (504 dof), based on an F-test
the addition of the blackbody component improves the fit by 4.2 sigma.
In the intrinsic column density vs. redshift plane there is just one
deep minimum hinting for a redshift z=0.07^+0.13_-0.04 (90% confidence
level) and an intrinsic column density N_H(z)=(1.5^+0.5_-0.2)x10^21 cm^-2.
The power law component shows a small softening from the first to the
second orbit, with a photon index around 2.2-2.4.
The blackbody component is hot with a temperature of ~1 keV, consistent
among the two observations. The blackbody radius decreases from the first
observation to the second from ~2x10^10 cm to ~0.6x10^10 cm.

Ground-based optical follow-up observations are strongly encouraged in order

extinction.

Also, additional R-band observation of the GRB011121 field carried out

Spectroscopy of the host galaxy of GRB 101225A (Racusin et al., GCN
11493; Xu et al. GCN 11519) was carried out at the 10m Keck-I
telescope equipped with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS)
around 10 UT, 6th Jan. 2011, with a good seeing ~0.7"". A 900s spectrum
was obtained and it consists of a red and a blue channels, covering
~3200-5500 A and ~5000-8200 A, respectively. The spectrum has a low
signal-to-noise ration and the trace is best detected in the red
channel. Three weak emission lines are found at a common redshift of
z=0.40, considered as Hbeta (4861 AA), and the O III (4960 AA, 5007
AA).

Isotropic energy: >~ 7.8+/-1.6 x10^50 erg, using the BAT fluence

The absence of evidence for an emerging SN at the above redshift
suggests that GRB 101225A is a SN-less or SN-weak long GRB event.

Following the release of the refined X-ray position (Osborne et al., GCN 
11526) of the afterglow of GRB 110106A (Mangano et al., GCN 11520), we 
further inspected our TNG images. The faint object reported by Malesani 
et al. (GCN 11524) is significantly outside the revised error circle, 
and is thus likely unrelated to the GRB.

The new X-ray position however partially covers the outskirts of the 
extended object mentioned in GCN 11520.

A 1-hr TNG spectrum of this galaxy, starting on Jan 6.878 UT (5.64 hr 
after the GRB) and covering the wavelength range 3800-8000 AA, reveals 
the presence of a few emission features, which we interpret as Halpha, 
[NII] 6583, [SII] 6730, and weak Hbeta at a common redshift z=0.093. At 
the same redshift, we also see Ca H and K in absorption.

While the XRT error circle (1.7"" radius) overlaps the stellar light from 
the galaxy, its center lies 4.3"" away of the galaxy nucleus (7.3 kpc in 
projection at z=0.093). Such large offset would be more typical of 
short-duration GRBs, although the duration of GRB 110106A (T90 = 
4.3+-1.1 s; Stamatikos et al., GCN 11527) seems to exclude this 
hypothesis. The relation between the galaxy and the GRB cannot be

We re-analyzed the 900s low signal-to-noise spectrum reported in our

emission features is due to bad removal of a cosmic ray hit. The two
other features are close to sky emission lines. We thus conclude that
the reported redshift of z=0.4 in GCN #11522 for this event is not
secure and may be wrong. Deep spectroscopic observations from 8-10 m

The combined and flux-calibrated spectrum shows a smooth, very blue
continuum without any absorption of emission features, consistent with the
spectral observations from WHT (GCN 11502, Wiersema et al.), MMT (GCN

different times after the trigger. The continuum is well fitted using a

Considering the very flat optical light curve, the apparent color changes
in the optical SED, the shape of the X-ray spectrum (GCN 11501, Campana et

We observed the afterglow of GRB 101219B (Gelbord et al., GCN 11473) 
with the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO-VLT UT2. Observations 
were taken on two epochs, 2010 Dec 20.17 and 2011 Jan 5.09 UT (11.6 hr 
and 16.4 days after the burst, respectively). Exposure times were 80 and 
120 min, respectively.

In the first-epoch spectrum, the afterglow is detected over the full 
spectral range from about 3200 to 22,000 AA. A careful analysis provides 
a tentative redshift z=0.5519 based on detection of weak Mg II and Mg I. 
No other clear features can be found at the same redshift either in 
absorption or emission.

The second-epoch spectrum was taken 16.4 days after the GRB, which 
corresponds to 10.6 days in the rest frame at z=0.55. The continuum is 
again detected, over the wavelength range 3500 to 22,000 AA, and is 
substantially redder. No narrow emission lines can be distinguished, but 
broad SN-like undulations are apparent, particularly around 8000 AA. We 
carried out a comparison of our spectrum with those of SN 1998bw (Patat 
et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 900) transformed at various redshifts. We find a 
convincing match at z~0.55 after comparing with a spectrum taken on 1998 
May 4 (i.e., 12 days after the GRB). The observed flux is consistent 
assuming a roughly equal contribution from a SN as bright as SN 1998bw 
and an underlying host galaxy. The match of the spectral shape, 
brightness, and spectral epoch together strenghten both the redshift 
determination and the existence of a SN associated with GRB 101219B.

Our findings are in good agreement with the GROND observations reported 
by Olivares et al. (GCN 11578).

of GRB 110205A (Swift/BAT trigger #444643: Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 
11629, Markwardt et al. GCN Circ. 11646).  The joint spectral analysis 
of the Swift/BAT and the Suzaku/WAM data allows us to derive the broad-band 
spectral parameters of this burst.

The time interval of the spectral data for each instrument is chosen
from T0(BAT)+20.2 to T0(BAT)+318.2 sec where T0(BAT) is the trigger time
of BAT at 02:02:41.3 UTC.  The energy ranges which we used in the joint
spectral analysis are 15-150 keV and 100-3000 keV for the Swift/BAT and 
the Suzaku/WAM respectively. The spectral data of two instruments are 
fitted with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to take
into account the systematic effective area uncertainties in the response
matrices of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law with exponential cutoff 
model: dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). The constant factors 
of each instrument agree within 10%.  No systematic residual from the 
best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  The 
best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = -1.59 (-0.06/+0.07) and Epeak 
= 230 (-65/+135) keV (chi2/dof = 96.6/85).  A simple power-law fit 
shows a poor fit to the data (chi2/dof=126.4/86).  The best fit spectral 
parameters for the Band function fixing beta = -2.5 are: 
alpha = -1.57 (-0.08/+0.10), and Epeak = 200 (-60/+130) keV (chi2/dof = 96.9/85).
Our best fit spectral parameters are consistent with the Konus-Wind 
result based on the 3 channel data (Golenetskii et al. GCN Circ. 11659).  
The energy fluence in the 15-3000 keV band calculated by a power-law with

For GRB 110402A (Trigger 450545, GCNs 11857 & 11866),
the spectral lag analysis of the Swift-BAT data from T+0.8 sec to T+6.0 sec
(the initial 5 spikes), yields a lag of 3.7 +2.5/-2.9 msec for the
25-50 to 100-300 keV bands using a lightcurve binning of 4 msec.
While the 5.2 sec duration for the 5 spikes is formally beyond
the cononical 2-s boundary in duration for short bursts,
the small lag value favors a short burst identification.

We have obtained medium-resolution optical spectroscopy of the optical
counterpart (Cenko et al., GCN 11827) of the high-energy transient GRB
110328A / Swift J164449.3+573451 (Cummings et al., GCN 11823) with the
DEIMOS spectrograph mounted on the Keck II telescope.  Observations began
at 14:55 UT on 2011 Mar 31 and cover the wavelength range from 4500-9500
A.

We identify strong nebular emission features associated with [O II], [O
III], H-beta, H-alpha, [N II], and [S II] at a redshift consistent with
that reported by Levan et al. (GCN 11833) and Thoene et al. (GCN 11834).
Using a preliminary flux calibration, we find that the Balmer decrement
(H-alpha / H-beta) is only marginally larger than the value expected for
Case B recombination (consistent at the 2 sigma level).  This would
suggest that the observed red colors of the optical / NIR counterpart
(e.g., Morgan et al., GCN 11845; Levan et al., GCN 11846) are either due
to 1) an intrinsically red transient source, or 2) dust localized to the
source of the transient emission (which does not affect the bulk of the
ongoing star formation in the galaxy).

Constructing a diagnostic diagram (e.g., Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich
1981, PASP, 93, 5) based on the observed ratio of the narrow emission
lines, we find the source falls within the locus of star-forming
galaxies, and thus does not appear to exhibit any evidence for past
nuclear activity.  A plot of the diagnostic diagram of the host, showing

GRB 110715A was detected by Swift/BAT (Sonbas et al., GCN 12158;
Ukwatta et al., GCN 12160),  Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al., GCN
12166), and Suzaku/WAM (Ohmori et al., GCN 12184). The prompt emission
of this burst has a high photon count rate. And the lightcurve shows a
multi-peaked structure lasting ~5s (i.e., T0+5s, where T0 is the
trigger time), followed by a much weaker emission up to ~T0+20s.
Therefore, the overall T90 duration is ~10s or even a bit longer. On
the other hand, such a lightcurve feature is reminiscent of previous
short bursts with extended tail emissions.

With the redshift z = 0.82 (Piranomonte et al., GCN 12164) and the
cosmological parameters H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27,
Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the isotropic energy release E_iso is (4.1 
0.4)x10^52 erg, the isotropic peak luminosity L_iso,p is (3.9 
0.2)x10^52 erg/s, and the rest-frame \nu_F\nu peak energy Ep_rest is
220  20 keV (Golenetskii et al., GCN 12166). Thus, the values of Eiso
and Ep_rest are well consistent with the Eiso-Ep_rest relation (i.e.,
Amati relation) for long GRBs (or collapsar bursts).

The Swift/BAT data were reduced in a standard way and a CCF method was
used to derive spectral lags upon the lightcurves with 0.064s binning
(Xu et al., ApJ, 696, 971). We found lags of 0.04+/-0.01s (1sigma) for
15-25 V.S. 25-50 keV and 0.04+/-0.01 (1sigma) for 50-75 V.S. 75-350
keV. Thus, this event also fits the Liso-spectral lag relation for
long GRBs.

We performed the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis 
of GRB 110801A (Swift/BAT trigger #458521: De Pasquale et al., GCN Circ. 12228, 
Barthelmy et al. GCN Circ. 12237).  Since the Konus-Wind observed this GRB 
in the waiting mode, we only have 3 channel spectral data for the Konus-Wind 
which cover the energy range from 20 keV to 1.2 MeV.  The joint spectral 
analysis of the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data allows us to derive 
the broad-band spectral parameters of this burst. 

The time interval of the spectral data is chosen from T0(BAT)-26.43 to 
T0(BAT)+64.83 sec and from T0(BAT)+332.74 to T0(BAT)+388.67 sec where T0(BAT) 
is the trigger time of BAT at 19:49.43 UTC to include two time-separated episodes.  
The energy ranges which we used in the joint spectral analysis are 20-1200 keV 
and 14-150 keV for the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral 
data of two instruments are fitted with the spectral model multiplied by the 
constant factor to take into account the systematic effective area uncertainties 
in the response matrices of each instrument. 

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law with exponential cutoff model: 
dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak).  The constant factors of each 
instrument agree within 10%. No systematic residual from the best fit model is 
seen in the spectral data of each instrument (see Sakamoto et al. 2011, PASJ, 63, 
215 for the spectral cross-calibration).  The best fit spectral parameters are: 
alpha = -1.70 (-0.15/+0.12) and Epeak = 140 (-60/+900) keV (chi2/dof = 74/58).  
The best fit spectral parameters for the GRB (Band) model fixing beta = -2.5 are: 
alpha = -1.70 (-0.15/+0.22), and Epeak = 140 (-50/+1270) keV (chi2/dof = 74/58). 
The energy fluence in the 15-1200 keV band calculated by a power-law with 
exponential cutoff model for this 147.2 sec interval is 7.3 (-0.9/+ 1.7)x10^-6 erg/cm2.  

Assuming z=1.858 (Cabrera Lavers et al. GCN Circ. 12234) and a standard cosmology 
model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27, Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the isotropic 
energy release is E_iso = 1.0 (-0.2/+0.3) x10^53 erg in 1 keV to 10 MeV at the 
GRB rest frame extrapolating the best Band function fit fixing beta = -2.5.

We obtained 75 minutes of integration (five 15-minute exposures) on
SN2002ap using the echelle spectrograph (ARCES) on the Apache Point
Observatory 3.5-meter telescope.  The spectra were taken with a 1.6
arcsecond wide slit, 3.2 arcsec long, in seeing of about 1.5 arcsec.
The spectra give complete spectral coverage from 3600 A to 10500A. The
signal to noise ratio (per pixel) is about 20 at Ca II and 50 at Na I.

These spectra, at a resolution of 8 km/s, show clear detections of
interstellar NaI and CaII in both the Milky Way and M74.  A  weak,
narrow, NaI feature (D1 and D2) is detected in M74 with a column
density of approximately 2.5e11, suggesting there may be little cold
interstellar gas in M74 in front of the SN.  Assuming the ""typical""
Galactic relation between NaI and HI, this fact would suggest a total
hydrogen column of approximately 5e19 in M74 along this sightline.  Two
components are seen in M74 in CaII; one narrow, corresponding in
velocity to the NaI absorption noted above, and a second broader
component, approximately +25 km/sec with respect to the Na I feature.
The Ca II features each span roughly 50 km/sec, and are centered near
650 km/sec (heliocentric).  The Galactic Na I and Ca II lines are about
5 times stronger that their M74 counterparts in the SN spectrum.  This
object, while it is still bright, is ideal for measuring interstellar
abundances in the outer part of the M74 galaxy.

This sightline passes near the location of a known Galactic high
velocity H I cloud (Wakker 2001) at approximately -100 km/sec (LSR);
however, no absorption is detected at these velocities in either Ca II
or Na I to limits of 20 and 10 milli-Angstroms respectively.

No other significant narrow absorption or emission lines were seen in
the spectrum.

J. Norris (BSU), T. N. Ukwatta (MSU)

We report the spectral lag analysis for GRB 111020A (GCN Circ. 12460) 
based on the BAT data.  Using 64 ms binned light curves, the spectral 
lag for 15-25 keV to 50-100 keV is 124 +36/-38 msec.  This significant 
lag is due to a broader pulse in the 15-25 keV band comparing to that 
in the 50-100 keV band which indicates the strong pulse evolution from 
hard to soft.  Although the burst duration itself is short (T90 = 400 ms; 
GCN Circ. 12464), this positive lag argues against a ""short"" classification.  

However, there is a possibility that the broader pulse seen in the 
15-25 keV band is composed from two pulses instead of a single pulse.  
If this is the case, the lag result above could be confused by 
cross-correlating the 2nd pulse in the 15-25 keV and the 1st pulse 
in the 50-100 keV band.  Due to the limiting signal-to-noise in the 
light curve data, it is not possible to claim whether the broad pulse 
in the 15-25 keV has two pulses or just a single pulse.  

Give the large non-zero lag and the possible double peak interpretation
that could cause a false lag, we think it equally like that this burst 
is short or long.

report:


High-resolution spectra of SN 2002ap were aquired using the
Echelle-spectrograph at the Tautenburg 2-m telescope on February 2.8 UT 
and 3.8 UT. The detector is a 2k x 2k CCD chip with 15 micron
pixels. The spectral resolution was R = 70 000 (0.04 Angstrom per
pixel; slit 1.04 arcsec). At the time of the observations SN 2002ap
was at an apparent magnitude of about V=12. The spectra were
reduced in a standard fashion. Wavelength calibration was performed
by means of ThAr lamps. The signal-to-noise ratio of the combined
images is about 30. This is sufficiently high to check the spectrum
for lines from the interstellar medium in the supernova host galaxy
(M 74).

In the combined spectra we detect an absorption feature at a
heliocentric velocity of (660 +/- 2) km/s what we attribute to
redshifted NaI D1 at the velocity of the host [1, 2]. For the D1
component we measure an equivalent width of (30 +/- 5) milli-Angstrom,
whereas the redshifted D2 component is blended with a telluric line.
Assuming that the empirical relation between the equivalent width of
Na I D1 and interstellar reddening in our Galaxy [3] is also
representative for the interstellar medium in M 74 we arrive at a
reddening in the supernova host of E(B-V) = (0.008 +/- 0.002)
mag. Thus, assuming a ratio of total-to-selective extinction of about
3, our data are in agreement with A_V (host) = (0.025 +/- 0.005)
magnitudes. In other words, at a projected distance of the supernova
of about 13.5 kpc from the center of M 74 (assuming a distance of 10

3000-25000 AA.

In the spectra (reduced with archival calibration files) we detect several
absorption lines, like Ly-alpha, CIV, FeII and MgII, and the correspondent
Lyman limit absorption, at a redshift consistent with that reported by

We also note the presence of a strong intervening Mg II system at z = 1.998.

The afterglow of Swift GRB 111209A (Hoversten et al., GCN 12632, Klotz
et al., GCN 12633, Fugazza et al., GCN 12634) was observed with the
X-shooter spectrograph mounted at the Kueyen unit of the VLT on Cerro
Paranal, Chile. Starting around 1 UT on 10 December 2011 (0.75 days
after the burst), a series of four spectra of 1200s each were secured,
covering the approximate wavelength range 0.3-2.5 micron. The slit
width was set to 1"", resulting in a resolving power range of
4500-7500.

Preliminary reduction of the ultraviolet and visual parts of the
spectra shows a smooth continuum with several absorption features that
we can identify with resonance absorption lines of FeII, MgII, MgI,
CaII H and K at a redshift of z=0.677; this is the likely redshift of
GRB 111209A.

began spectroscopic observations of the optical afterglow of GRB 120327A 
(Sbarufatti et al., GCN 13123) using GMOS-South on the Gemini-South 8-m 
telescope.  We acquired four exposures of 800s each using the B600 
grating, with wavelength coverage between 3865-6680 Angstroms.

In the reduced spectrum we identify a strong damped Lyman-alpha system 
at z=2.81 as well as numerous narrow absorption lines corresponding to 
(among others) CIV, CII, OI, SiII at the same redshift, as well as 
possible Lyman-beta.   We therefore identify this as the redshift of the 
GRB.

We thank German Gimeno and the Gemini staff for prompt execution of the

We observed the optical/NIR afterglow (e.g., Sbarufatti et al., GCN# 13123, Klotz et al., GCN#13124, Smith et al., GCN#13125) of the Swift GRB 120327A (Sbarufatti et al., GCN# 13123) with the VLT/UT2 equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Observations started around 05:03 UT on 2012-03-27, which is roughly 2.13 hrs after the trigger. Four exposures in a nodding pattern with an integration time of 600 s each were obtained. The spectrum covers an approximate wavelength range between 3100 and 23000 AA. The slit width was set to 1"" in the ultra-violet/blue arm, and 0.9"" in the visual and near-infrared arm, resulting in a resolving power range of approximately 4500-7500.

Preliminary reduction of the spectrum shows a well detected continuum with several absorption features, that we identify with Ly-limit and Ly-alpha as well as absorption lines of CII/CII*, SiII/SiII*, AlI, FeII and MgII at a redshift of 2.813. This is confirms previous reports based on spectroscopy (Perley & Tanvir, GCN #13133) and photometry (Sudilovsky et al. GCN #13129).

In the acquisition frame (taken 15.9 hr after the GRB), the afterglow is detected at low S/N. Comparison with two closeby SDSS stars yields R ~ 21.3 (Vega), with a systematic uncertainty of ~0.3 mag.

Four exposures in a nodding pattern with an integration time of 2400 s each were obtained in poor sky conditions. The spectrum covers an approximate wavelength range between 3000 and 25000 AA. The slit width was set to 1"" in the ultra-violet/blue arm, and 0.9"" in the visual and near-infrared arms, resulting in a resolving power range of approximately 4500-7500.

GTO collaboration:

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 120422A (Troja et al., GCN 
13243; Cucchiara et al., GCN 13245) with the ESO VLT equipped with the 
X-shooter spectrograph. Observations started on 2012 April 22.99 UT 
(16.5 hr after the GRB), for a total exposure time of 80 min in each of 
the UVB, VIS, and NIR arms, covering the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA. 
The slit was aligned so to cover both the galaxy at z = 0.28 present in 
the SDSS (Cucchiara et al., GCN 13245; Tanvir et al., GCN 13251) and the 
GRB optical counterpart (Cucchiara et al., GCN 13245).

We detect a plethora of nebular emission lines from the candidate host 
galaxy, including [O II], [O III], Balmer lines up to Hzeta, [N II], [S 
II], at a common redshift z = 0.283, thus confirming the results of 
Tanvir et al. (GCN 13251).

The trace of the GRB counterpart is rather blue (see also Nardini et 
al., GCN 13256), and we detect Mg II at z = 0.283 in absorption. No 
further absorption features are visible. We also note that the spatial 
extent of the brightest emission lines from the SDSS galaxy encompasses 
the position of the GRB counterpart, indicating nebular emission at z = 
0.283 at the GRB position.

While a chance superposition cannot be excluded, we note that the lack 
of absorption features at z > 0.283 would require a very tenuous 
environment at the GRB location. Furthermore, the UVOT detection in all 
the UV filters (Kuin & Troja, GCN 13248) implies a low redshift z <~ 
1.3. Last, we note that the UVOT photometry at t ~ 5 ks after the burst 
reveals a very blue spectrum, which is not typical of GRB afterglows, 
but is reminiscent of the very blue early emission of GRB 060218 
(Campana et al. 2006, Nature, 442, 1008). We thus conclude that the GRB 
is also likely at z = 0.283.

Using the gamma-ray fluence reported by Barthelmy et al. (GCN 13246), at 
z = 0.283 the isotropic-equivalent energy release of GRB 120422A is 
~4.4*10^49 erg, which is typical of local GRBs, often associated with 
supernovae. We encourage photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to 
detect the emergence of a supernova, or lack thereof.

We imaged the field of GRB 120722A (Melandri et al., GCN

(10 hr after the GRB), for a total exposure time of 80 min in each of 
the UVB, VIS, and NIR arms, covering the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA. 
Within the XRT error circle we noted a SDSS object, which is coincident
with the position of the afterglow reported by Sudilovsky et al. (GCN 13506).
The slit was positioned on this object. The object reported by Sudilovsky et al. (GCN 13506) 
is faintly detected in a combined stack of the ugriz SDSS data, suggesting a significant host contribution. 
The object is also well detected in our R-band acquisition images.

The spectrum is dominated by several nebular emission lines from the candidate host galaxy, 
including [O II], [O III] and Balmer lines (Halpha, Hbeta and Hgamma), 
at a common redshift z = 0.9586. Given the superposition with
the optical afterglow reported by Sudilovsky et al. (GCN 13506), this is likely the
host galaxy of GRB120722A.

report:

The short GRB 120804A (Swift/BAT trigger #529686: Lien et al., GCN Circ.
13573, Baumgartner et al. GCN Circ. 13581) triggered Konus-Wind at
T0=3255.749 s UT (00:54:15.749), but since the incident angle on the
triggered detector was 99.2 deg (i.e. the burst accidentally triggered
the S2 detector which observes the northern ecliptic hemisphere,
although the burst came from the southern ecliptic hemisphere: b = -9.2
deg) the standard analysis of the Konus-Wind spectral data is impossible.

To derive the broad-band spectral parameters of this burst, we performed
joint spectral analysis of the Swift/BAT data and the Konus-Wind
3-channel spectral data (obtained in the waiting mode from the detector
S1), which covers the energy range from 24 keV to 1.4 MeV.

The time intervals of the spectral data are chosen for the Konus-Wind
from T0(BAT)-0.916 s to T0(BAT)+2.028 s (single KW bin which comprises
the burst) and for the Swift/BAT from T0(BAT)-0.16 s to T0(BAT)+0.83 s
(that is the BAT T100 interval), where T0(BAT) is the trigger time of
BAT at 00:54:14.18 UTC. The energy ranges which we used in the joint
spectral analysis are 24-1400 keV and 14-150 keV for the Konus-Wind and
the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of the two instruments 
are fitted with the spectral model multiplied by a constant factor to 
take into account the systematic effective area uncertainties in the 
response matrices of each instrument and the difference in the chosen 
intervals.

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law with exponential cutoff
model: dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). No systematic residual
from the best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.
The best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = -0.89 (-0.28, +0.24) and
Epeak = 135 (-29, +66) keV (chi2/dof = 56/58).

The energy fluence and 16-ms peak flux in the 15-1000 keV band
are 1.45 (-0.31,+0.30) x 10^-6 erg/cm2 and (6.0  2.7) x 10^-6 erg/cm2/s 
respectively.

USNO stars).

Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA, and were taken 
starting on 2012 Aug 15.163 UT (1.69 hr after the GRB), for a total of 
40 min exposure. Continuum from the afterglow is detected with high S/N 
in all of the UVB, VIS, and NIR arms.

The spectrum shows a wide trough and a multitude of strong absorption 
lines, which we interpret as due to a DLA and metal transitions of N V, 
S II, Si II, O I, C IV, Si IV, Fe II, Al II, Al III, Mn II, Mg II, Mg I, 
among others, at a common redshift z = 2.358. At the same redshift, we 
also detect fine-structure lines of Ni II and Fe II, thus confirming 
conclusively that this is the GRB redshift. We also detect intervening

Spectra of the proposed optical/radio counterpart of GRB 980703 (see GCN
Circ. 128) were obtained by R. Goodrich at the Keck-II telescope on July 
7.6 UT.  The object has a very blue continuum, one strong emission line
at approximately 7330 A, and several absorption features in the blue
part of the spectrum.  If the emission line is identified as [O II] 3727,
then the redshift is 0.967.  The line cannot be Ly alpha, since there is
no sign of intergalactic absorption blueward of it.  No broad emission
lines are seen at this stage of reductions; the spectrum is thus unlike
that of a quasar or a BL Lac, and it is consistent with a young, compact,
unobscured starburst.  (We note however that the object is unresolved
in our images obtained in half-arcsec seeing.)

Further analysis of these and other observations is in progress.

GCN 13795, Klotz et al., GCN 13799, Yershov et al., GCN 13803, Kuin et al., GCN 13808) of GRB 120922A (Yershov et al., GCN 13793). Tying our photometric solution to field stars from the SDSS in the optical filters and 2MASS in the NIR, we derive the following AB magnitudes centered at a midtime of 00:01 UTC on September 23 (approx 1.5 hrs after the trigger):

g' = 20.53 +/- 0.05

After correcting these magnitudes for the expected Galactic foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_B-V = 0.15 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998), the SED is well fit with a simple power law of spectral index \beta = 0.5 +/- 0.2 and no strong evidence for host-intrinsic reddening. The significant drop in flux in the g'-band suggests a photometric redshift of 3.1 +/- 0.2, consistent with the lack of detection in the bluer UVOT filters (Kuin et al., GCN 13808).",3.1 +/- 0.2,GRB 120922A,GROND,Photometric

We performed a careful analysis of the spectrum secured at the NOT

redshift z = 0.58 suggested in GCN 13856 is therefore not correct.

A sharp break is detected at the blue end of our spectrum around 4100 
AA, but its interpretation is not straightforward. If due to Ly alpha at 
z = 2.3, than we would expect surviving flux blueward of the break. If 
due to the Lyman limit at z = 3.4, than we would expect to see the Lyman 
forest redward of the break, which we do not. We thus believe this break 
to be an artifact of the data, but encourage other observers to attempt

GRB 980703 (see GCN Circ. 128, 136, 137) gives the following results:

The strong emission line is definitively identified as [O II] 3727 at
the redshift z_em = 0.9660 +- 0.0002.  It has the equivalent width of
90 +- 2 Angstroms (observed), or 45.7 +- 1 A in the restframe.  This
is somewhit higher than typical for galaxies at comparable redshifts
and magnitudes.  After correcting for the as-yet unknown contribution
of the GRB afterglow to the continuum flux, these numbers will be higher.
The observed line flux is 2.7e-16 erg/cm2/s.

There are several absorption features identified as Fe II (2344, 2374,
2383, 2587, and 2600 A) and Mg II (2796 and 2803) lines, with the mean
redshift z_abs = 0.9653 +- 0.0007, superposed on an otherwise featureless
UV continuum.  This too is typical of actively star-forming galaxies at
similar redshifts.  We also see the 4000-Angstrom break.

The observed spectrophotometric magnitude at the epoch of these 
observations (July 7.6 UT) are:  B = 23.3, V = 22.65, and R = 21.9 mag, 
with the zero-point uncertain by a few tenths of a magnitude, due to the
unknown slit losses.  The UV continuum blueward of the [O II] line can
be described with a power-law F_nu ~ nu**alpha, with alpha = -1.5 +- 0.2,
possibly indicative of a modest extinction.

Assuming a Friedmann cosmology with H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_0 = 0.2, and
Lambda_0 = 0, the luminosity distance at this redshift is 1.9208e28 cm.
Our observed [O II] line flux then translates to the restframe line
luminosity of 1.25e42 erg/s.  Assuming the conversion from Kennicutt
(1992), the implied star formation rate is about 63 M_sun/yr, even 
without any extinction or slit-loss corrections.

We thus conclude that the host galaxy of GRB 980703 is a compact starburst
object.  This gives some support to the models which associate origins of
GRBs with massive star formation.

Further observations of the object are in progress.

poor conditions.  Our provisional reduction shows a generally featureless

If we identify this feature with the MgII doublet at 2796/2803A

GRB 121217A, following our theoretical considerations based on the Induced

solution with a cosmological redshift of z=0.8 (+- 0.1). We base this
result on a preliminary analysis of the superposition of the late X-ray
afterglow emission, considering GRB 090618 as the prototype of the class.
We have considered the first 75 ks of the X-ray afterglow light curve of
GRB 121217A in this preliminary analysis.
More details on the model will appear soon on the arXiv.

We also predict a presence of a SN emerging after about 18 (+- 3) days
from the GRB trigger, e.g. in the first days of January 2013.
Assuming an interstellar extinction obtained from the Schlegel et al.

we estimate an observed magnitude of +24.5 (+- 0.5) in the J filter. We
further notice that, given the galactic latitude less than 5 deg (-4.89

The spectrum exhibits two relatively broad troughs (centered at ~ 3800

respectively, at z=2.707. We measured the HI column density,
logN(HI)~21.7, from the Lyman-alpha feature. At this redshift there
are tentative indications of other metal absorption features, although
they are weak and we have yet to establish their significance. The
lack of strong resonance metal lines, together with the low X-ray
absorption (Sonbas et al., GCN 14115), suggests a low metallicity. We
also report a tentative evidence for an intervening MgII absorber at

time of 750 and 720 s, respectively. Consistent with the latest XRT 
position (Osborne et al. GCN 12857; see also

This position is consistent with that of the tentative near-infrared

A spectrum of this source was taken on 2013 Feb 13 with the ESO VLT 
equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph, covering the wavelength range 
3000-20500 AA. The seeing was 0.6"". In the NIR arm, we detect several

hints for [O III] (4959) and [O II] (3727) at a common redshift z = 
2.943. The weakness/lack of other prominent lines usually seen in GRB 
host spectra is readily explained by their location in non-favorable 
parts of the spectrum. In the UVB arm, the host continuum is detected 
down to ~4750 AA, which corresponds to the onset of the Lyman alpha 
forest at z = 2.943.

At z = 2.94 the host is a fairly luminous galaxy at 2000  rest-frame, 
roughly 0.5 mag brighter than L* at that redshift (e.g. Gabasch et al.

identified an object within 1 arcsecond of CXOU J151455.8-192454 and
suggested that the object is the host galaxy of GRB 020531. 

On June 12, 2002 (UT) we undertook imaging and spectroscopic
observations with the Echelle Spectrograph & Imager (ESI) on Keck II.
With a seeing of 0.6 arcseconds in the R and I bands we confirm that
the candidate object is indeed extended, with a size of about 1
arcsecond. Next, we obtained four 1800-s spectroscopic exposures
(Echelle mode) and found two features: a broad feature (Gaussian full
width at half maximum of 11.6 A) centered on 7455 Angstrom (A) and a
fainter feature centered around 9725 A.  We suggest that the broad
feature is the  [O II] 3728.8/3726.0 doublet with an intrinsic velocity
dispersion of 330 km/s and the fainter feature is Hbeta. If these
identifications are correct then the redshift of the candidate host
galaxy is 1.00.

The fluence and peak flux of GRB 020531 over the energy range 50 to 300
keV are 8E-7 erg cm^-2 and 6.4E-7 erg cm^-2 s^-1, respectively (Lamb et

with Omega-m=0.3, the isotropic energy release (without any k

Lamb et al. (ibid) argue that GRB 020531 is a burst which belongs to
the short duration group. The isotropic energy release of this short

Inside the enhanced X-ray error-circle

with uncertainties of 0.3"" in each coordinate.
Registering the early afterglow images (Olivares et al., GCN 11020)
against the late host frame, we derive an offset between galaxy
center and afterglow of approximately 0.4"".

A spectrum of this galaxy was taken on 2012-11-15 with the ESO VLT

A spectrum of the GRB 130427A afterglow was obtained with the
Large Binocular Telescope (LBT+MODS1 instrument) on 2013 May 7.15 (UT),
9.8 days after the burst. The spectrum covers 340 nm to 950 nm and
is dominated by a power-law continuum. Narrow Balmer, [OII], [OIII]
emission lines, and MgII and MgI absorption lines from the host
galaxy are present at a redshift of 0.340.

The LBT spectrum shows no obvious undulations characteristic of a
broad-lined type Ic supernova such as SN 1998bw. In contrast,
a 98bw-like supernova was detectable from GRB 030329 around
seven days after its burst (Stanek et al. 2003, ApJ, 591, L17).
This early detection was primarily due to the prominent peak
seen around 500 nm (rest frame) in broad-lined type Ic events.

Adding a pre-maximum spectrum of SN 1998bw
(Patat et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 900) to a power-law continuum
suggests that any 98bw-like supernova is at least an R-band

Inside the 2"".6 refined XRT error circle, we detect a source not visible

We obtained spectroscopy of the optical counterpart and host galaxy of 
GRB 130427A (Maselli et al., GCN 14448; Elenin et al., GCN 14450) with the 
10.4m GTC telescope, 16.7 days after the GRB onset. This is 12.5 days in the 
host galaxy rest-frame (z = 0.34; Levan et al. GCN 14455, Xu et al. GCN 14478 
and Flores et al. GCN 1449). Observations consisted of 4x1200s with the 
R500R grism, covering the range between 4800 and 10000 AA with a 
resolution of ~600. The slit was oriented to cover both the afterglow and the 
host galaxy centre.

The spectrum has a strong contribution from the host galaxy. To overcome this, 
we built a synthetic host galaxy spectrum based on the SDSS (DR9) photometry 
using LePhare (version 2.2, Arnouts et al. 1999, MNRAS, 310, 540; Ilbert et al. 
2006, A&A, 457, 841). We then subtracted this host galaxy template from the 
GTC spectrum to obtain a ""clean"" spectrum of the counterpart associated to GRB 
130427A.

The resulting spectrum is that of a broad-lined Ic SN, with a prominent bump at 
~6800 A observer frame. In particular, we obtain an excellent match with the 
spectrum of  SN 2010bh at 12.7 (rest-frame) days after GRB 100316D 
(Bufano et al. 2012, ApJ 753, 67).

We stress that this conclusion is independent of the host galaxy model 
adopted. By running SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) on the 
original spectrum (i.e. including host contamination), we still obtain good 
matches with a series of broad-lined Type Ic SNe, including SNe 1998bw, 
1997ef, 2002ap and 2006aj, albeit at a lower redshift. The fact that SNID 
suggests a lower redshift  is explained by the fact that SN 2010bh had high 
expansion velocities, reaching ~34000 km/s at similar phases (Bufano et al. 
2012, ApJ 753, 67), which we suggest is also the case for the SN associated 
with GRB 130427A.

At this epoch we obtained imaging and spectroscopy of the brightest source in the XRT error box (S1 in Xu et al. GCN 14653 and Cenko et al. GCN 14656). This spectrum exhibits several broad absorption features consistent with an M-dwarf star at z=0, indicating that it is not the host galaxy of GRB 130515A.

In fact, preliminary analysis of our imaging suggests that sources S2 and S3 referred to by Xu et al. and Cenko et al. are also consistent with being point-like.  The nearest evidently extended, and reasonably bright, source is a galaxy at position 18:53:45.01  -54:16:50.9, approximately 8 arcsec from the current enhanced X-ray position (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/00555880/).

afterglow (Maselli et al. GCNC 14448, Elenin et al. GCNC 14450) with the
6-meter BTA equipped with Scorpio. The spectra (with exposure times of
4 x 900 s, 5 x 900 s and 4 x 1200 s) were taken on May 2/3, 5/6 and
10/11 respectively. We used the VPHG 550G grating which covers the
3700-7900 A spectral range and provides a 13 A spectral resolution.

Narrow host galaxy lines such as 3727 A [OII], [OIII] 4959 A, 5007 A and
Balmer lines are noticeable in all spectra. The measured redshift is 0.3393,
in good agreement with the previously reported values (Levan et al. GCNC
14455; Xu et al. GCNC 14478; Flores et al. GCNC 14491; Garnavich GCNC 14605
and Perley & Tang, GCNC 14615). Particularly, we detect marginal excess
emission in the range 6000-7000 A on the later spectrum obtained on May
10/11, which can be interpreted as evidence of the underlying SN (de
Ugarte Postigo et al., GCNC 14646), what is also supported by the
long-term photometric observations (Trotter et al., GCNC 14662; Watson et

report:

We performed the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis of 
GRB 130514A (Swift/BAT trigger #555821: Sonbas et al., GCN Circ. 14632, 
Ukwatta et al. GCN Circ. 14636). Since the Konus-Wind observed this GRB 
in the waiting mode, we only have 3 channel spectral data for the 
Konus-Wind which cover the energy range from 20 keV to 1.2 MeV.  The
joint spectral analysis of the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data allows 
us to derive the broad-band spectral parameters of this burst.

The time interval of the spectral data for each instrument is chosen 
from T0(BAT)-5.1 to T0(BAT)+153.9 s where T0(BAT) is the trigger time of 
BAT at 07:13:41 UTC. This interval comprises whole burst as observed by 
Konus-Wind and contains 87% of the total fluence in the 15-150 keV as 
observed by BAT (Ukwatta et al. GCN Circ. 14636).

The energy ranges which we used in the joint spectral analysis are 
20-1200 keV and 14-150 keV for the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT 
respectively.  The spectral data of two instruments are fitted with the 
spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to take into account 
the systematic effective area uncertainties in the response matrices of 
each instrument.

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law with exponential cutoff 
model: dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). No systematic residual 
from the best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument. 
The BAT constant factor is 0.83(-0.08,+0.10) (the KW constant factor is 
fixed to 1). The best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = 
-1.44(-0.14,+0.17) and Epeak = 110(-21,+42) keV (chi2/dof = 41.9/57). 
The best fit spectral parameters for the GRB (Band) model fixing beta = 
-2.5 are:  alpha = -1.44(-0.15,+0.17), and Epeak = 108(-21,+45)  keV 
(chi2/dof = 43.6/57). The energy fluence in the 15-1200 keV band 
calculated by a power-law with exponential cutoff model for this 159 s 
interval is 1.40(-0.16,+0.21)x10^-5 erg/cm2.

Assuming a photo-z of 3.6 (Schmidl, Kann, and Greiner GCN Circ. 14634) 
and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27, 
Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the isotropic energy release is E_iso = 
4.95(-0.67,+0.85)x10^53 erg in 1 keV to 10 MeV at the GRB rest frame 
extrapolating the best exponential cutoff function fit.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

The spectrum shows a strong trace of the afterglow with absorption lines of the Ca II doublet as well as MgII and MgI. Superimposed are emission lines from the host galaxy of [OII], [OIII], Hbeta and Hgamma extended in the spatial direction. Absorption and emission lines lie at a common redshift of z=0.356.

Xu (DARK/NBI), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), S. Geier (NOT, DARK/NBI), Z. Cano(U. Iceland), P. Jakobsson (U. Iceland) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 130702A (Singer et al., GCN 14967; Cheung et al., GCN 14971; Collazzi et al., GCN 14972) with the Nordic Opitcal Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC. In addition to our photometric observations (reported in Schulze et al., GCN 14978), we obtained an optical spectrum, with a total exposure of 2 x 1800 s, using Grism #4 and covering the wavelength range 3750 - 9000 AA at a resolution of 17 AA.

The slit was oriented to cover both the transient source (also dubbed iPTF13bxl) that has been suggested to be the afterglow of GRB 130702A, and the bright SDSS galaxy located 7.6"" South of the source (SDSS J142914.57+154619.3; Singer et al., GCN 14967). 

The galaxy is found to be at z = 0.145, based on Ca II H & K absorption and emission by [OII] and Halpha. The emission features are weak and we do not detect Hbeta or [OIII]. Overall, and combined with the SDSS colors, this galaxy shows very weak star formation activity. 

This redshift is consistent with the redshift of the transient source reported by Mulchaey et al. (ATel 5191) and the description given there. The trace of our NOT spectrum at the location of the transient is mostly featureless and we cannot detect the emission lines reported by Mulchaey et al., probably due to a lower S/N.

The common redshift suggests that the transient source iPTF13bxl is associated with the galaxy SDSS J142914.57+154619.3. If this transient is indeed the afterglow of GRB 130702A at z = 0.145, it implies an E_iso = (3.0 +- 1.0) * 10^50 erg in the 10-1000 keV (Collazzi et al., GCN 14972).

We note that this is an unusual environment for a long GRB: located at a large offset (19.1 kpc in projection) from a relatively passive galaxy. However, we cannot exclude that more sources in the field, including the fainter (r ~ 23 mag) object at 0.6"" from the transient (SDSS J142914.75+154626.0; Singer et al., GCN 14967) might be at the same redshift. A possible confirmation of the GRB nature of this transient will be the emergence of an associated supernova. At z = 0.145, a supernova similar to SN 1998bw will peak at R ~ 19.8 mag about 20 days after the GRB, and will be easily detectable.",0.145,GRB 130702A,Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT),Spectroscopic

Carosati (INAF/TNG) report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration:

We continued monitoring the optical counterpart of the Fermi GRB 130702A (Singer et al., GCN 14967, Cheung et al. GCN 14971; Collazzi et al. GCN 14972) with the Italian 3.6m TNG telescope located in the Canary Islands, equipped with the DOLoRes camera.

In addition to what reported in D'Avanzo et al. (GCN 14977, GCN 14984), further observations were carried out during the nights of Jul 5 and Jul 9 (4 and 8 days after the Fermi GBM trigger).

At a mean t-t0=7.92 days we detect the optical counterpart in the SDSS r band with a magnitude of 19.91 (calibrated against nearby SDSS stars). This value is consistent with our previous epoch obtained 4 days before, confirming the flattening of the optical light curve reported by (Perley et al. GCN 14981, Butler et al. GCN 14993, Schulze et al. GCN 14994, Pozanenko et al. GCN 14996).

We also obtained a 2000 seconds spectrum with the LR-B grism, starting at t-t0=7.92 days, covering the wavelength range 3900-8200 AA with a resolution of R~600. With respect to our previous epoch  observation which featured a blue, featureless continuum (D'Avanzo et al. GCN 14984), the spectrum is now considerably redder, and shows a number of broad features similar to GRB-associated supernovae. In particular, the shape of the continuum closely resembles the spectrum of SN 1998bw observed at a similar epoch, despite a prominent feature at 4300 AA rest frame, reminiscent of what seen in SN 2006aj (Pian et al. 2006, Nature, 442, 1011). This confirms the emerging of the supernova already reported by Schulze et al. (GCN 14994) and Cenko et al. (GCN 14998).

absorption features, very much reminiscent of the spectrum of, e.g., GRB

The exposure time was 8x600 s. In the NIR arm, we detect two emission lines,
interpreted as [O III] (5007) and H-alpha at a common redshift z = 1.686.
In the spectrum we also detect absorption lines at the same redshift, albeit at 
low signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we measure significant fading of the source 
between two sets of acquisition images, confirming that we are seeing 
afterglow and host light.  Hence, we consider z = 1.686 the likely redshift of

Observations started on November 17, 2013, at 00:36:34 UT, 150 s after the
GRB trigger. They were performed at an average seeing of 1"".0 and at an
average airmass of 1.2 .

We detect the fading afterglow discovered by Trotter et al. (GCN 15491).

Based on a total exposure time of 460 s in g'r'i'z' and 480 s in JHK, at a
midtime of 0.80 hrs after the burst, we measure the following preliminary
AB magnitudes:

g' = 20.9 +/- 0.1,

Poor conditions meant that observations could not start until 01:42 UT,

The continuum level is faint, but we see a strong break corresponding
to Ly-alpha at a redshift of z=4.042.  This is supported by the detection
of absorption lines corresponding to SiII 1259/1260, SiIV 1393/1402
and SiII 1526.  There is also a clear Ly-a forest blueward of the break.
We therefore propose this as the redshift of the GRB, noting it
is consistent with the photometric redshift of Tanga et al. (GCN15493).

The late X-ray observations of GRB 060614 (A. M. Parsons et al., GCN 5252) by Swift-XRT clearly evidence a pattern typical of a family of GRBs associated to supernova (SN) following the Induced Gravitational Collapse (IGC) paradigm (1,2). By overlapping the X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity light curve of GRB 060614 with the one of GRB 090618, namely the IGC GRB-SN prototype (3), we estimate a theoretical redshift of z=1.2 (seeFig. 1http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB060614_Fig1.pdf), much higher than z=0.125 of the purported host galaxy (Price et al., GCN 5275; Fugazza et al., GCN 5276). This leads to the explanation of the absence of a visible SN (4,5,6), settling a long lasting dispute of a possible wrong redshift estimation given by a chance superposition of GRB 060614 with its purported host galaxy (7). GRB 060614 is therefore a canonical IGC GRB-SN system. We note that this new value of the redshift still marginally fulfills the Amati relation (see Fig. 2 http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB060614_Fig2.pdf), and that it is in agreement with z=1.45+/-0.85 given by the Atteia relation (A. Pelangeon & J-L. Atteia, GCN 5265) and with the observational limit of z<1.3 (99.99% CL) given by the combined ultraviolet/optical and X-ray spectra (8).

More optical observations in the GRB field are encouraged for the investigation of the actual host galaxy.

A total exposure of 1x900 s + 4x1200 s was obtained, covering the spectral range from ~3000 to ~24000 Ang. 
The afterglow is detected in the UVB and VIS arms with a faint continuum.

The X-ray observations of GRB 131202A (1) point to the possibility that it fulfills the IGC paradigm (2,3). A preliminary overlapping of its X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity within the one of GRB 090618, namely an IGC prototype (4), gives an estimate of the redshift of z~10 (see Fig. 1 http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB131202A_Fig1.pdf). Continuous monitoring and complementary observations in all possible wavelengths are encouraged.

The extension of the validity of the IGC paradigm to very large cosmological distances has already been clearly demonstrated by the case of GRB 090423 (5) at z=8.2 (6,7,8,9,10,11): its X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity again overlaps perfectly well with the one of GRB 090618 (see Fig. 2 http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB131202A_Fig2.pdf).

As a consequence, a supernova associated to GRB 140108A is expected to
emerge after 16 (+/- 3) days after the trigger.

Given the spectral parameters of the prompt emission by Swift/BAT

estimation leads to an isotropic energy of E_iso ~ 4x10^52 erg.

The late Swift/XRT observations of GRB 140206A (1,2) evidences the
fullfillment of the IGC paradigm (3,4). A preliminary overlapping of
its X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity with the one of GRB
090618, namely an IGC prototype (5), gives an estimate of the redshift
of z~0.6 (see Fig. 1 <http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB140206A.pdf>).

As a consequence, a supernova associated to GRB 140206A is expected to
emerge after 16 days after the trigger.

Continuous monitoring and complementary observations in all possible
wavelengths are encouraged.

Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC. Observations started at 19:56 UT 
on February 6 (i.e., 12.66 hr after the burst).

We first obtained a 100-s image in R band.  We clearly detect the source 
reported in Oksanen et al. (GCN 15786). The source has faded to 19.15 
+/- 0.10 mag (Vega magnitude), based on nearby USNO stars.

We aso obtained an optical spectrum, with a total exposure of 2 x 1800 
s, using grism #4 and a blocking filter covering the wavelength range 
3750 - 9000 AA at a resolution of 8.1 AA. The mid exposure time is 13.6 
hr after the GRB.

We detect several absorption lines which we interpret as due to Lyalpha, 
Si II, C II, C IV, Al II, Fe II at a common redshift of 2.73.

This measurement is not consistent with the predicted theoretical value 
by Ruffini et al. (GCN 15794).

We detect several absorption lines which we interpret as due to Ly-alpha,

Imaging Spectrometer on the Keck-I 10-m telescope on Oct. 8 UT.  We
detect the absorption lines due to Mg I, Mg II, and Fe II associated

also detect the unidentified absorption lines at 463, 466, 510, and
514.5 nm reported in GCN 1579, as well as the narrow emission line at
405 nm and the absorption lines between 400 and 404 nm (GCN 1599).

We identify the emission line as Lyman-alpha at z=2.323, in
contradiction to the identification as C IV in GCN 1599.  We note that
P-Cygni absorption line profiles from a hypothetical starburst host
galaxy should not be prominent above the bright continuum of the
transient.  In addition, we feel that a lone UV emission line is
significantly more likely to be Lyman-alpha than C IV.  The
previously unidentified absorption lines can now be identified as the
Si IV 1393.8, 1402.8 Angstrom doublet and C IV 1548.2, 1550.8
Angstrom doublet.  These absorption lines have multiple velocity
components, as does the Lyman-alpha absorption.  We note the
wavelength coincidence of one of the components of Lyman-alpha with
the expected C IV absorption from the Mg II system at z=1.603, but
believe it only to be a coincidence.

An additional point in favor of the z=2.323 interpretation is the
appearance of the continuum to the blue of the Lyman-alpha line.
While there is no substantial Lyman break, there are many more
absorption lines blueward of Lyman-alpha than redward.  A previously
unnoted absorption feature with multiple components is present at
341 nm, consistent with Lyman-beta at this redshift.

We obtained a spectrum with the double arm spectrograph ISIS at the
4.2-m WHT telescope at La Palma (Spain) on October 4. A partial
calibration of the blue arm spectrum (2 Angstrom spectral resolution)
reveals the presence of four absorption components at detected in CIV
at redshifts 2.295, 2.298, 2.320, and 2.327, i.e. spanning a total
velocity range of approximately 3000 km/s.  The latter three
components are also clearly detected in SiIV, with a marginal
detection of SiIV at z=2.295.  The lines around 4000-4050 Angstrom can
be then identified as Ly-alpha (for which we also detect the emission
component reported earlier); there is a close match for the components
at z=2.320 and 2.327, whilst the two lowest redshift Lya components
are blended.

The interpretation of this 4-component absorption system could be of
absorption local to the burst source, or of cosmological components.

If all arise local to the burst, we must be viewing through ejecta in
a supernova-like explosion. After a day, supernova ejecta are so
opaque that we cannot see through them, and so we must be viewing the
results of an explosion that occurred weeks or more before the burst,
as in the supranova model. The narrowness of the components then must
mean that the ejecta have already cooled and partly condensed into
filaments. It is a challenge to have this happen within weeks, and
given the small filling factor inherent to filamentation, to have our
line of sight intersect four filaments.

If cosmological, we see our line of sight pass through 4 mass
concentrations of a magnitude well in excess of lyman limit systems in
quasar absorption line terms. These would all be local to the host
galaxy in cosmological terms, but with velocity separations large for
even a present-day massive cluster. Given that only 10-20% of quasars
at redshift 1 - 2 have even one such system, one concludes nonetheless
that seeing four systems implies a physical relation between them.
Thus we would be seeing a very large cosmic structure at z=2.3 with an
extent of 3000 km/s in velocity space. This is very difficult to get
in any cosmology, and would push cosmological models to very low
values of Omega_matter.

Further high-resolution spectroscopy is required to resolve the
velocity structure, and to determine the abundances and thermodynamic
state of these absorption systems, in order that we may understand the
nature of this remarkable system. In local models, one might find
variability in the Lyman-alpha emission.  Since the source is now
fading past R=21, these observations are most urgent.

Zheng et al. GCN 16119; Guver et al. GCN 16120; Butler et al. GCN 16121)
with the GMOS-N spectrograph on Gemini-N.  Observations began
at 06:24 UT, approximately 2.3 hr post burst, and two different
settings covered a total wavelength range from about 4400AA to 10100AA.

The spectra reveal several strong absorption lines and in particular
there is a marked break at about 6027 AA which we identify as
Ly-a at a redshift z=3.956.  Blueward is a clear Ly-a forest.
At the same redshift we see strong lines of CIV (1548/1551) and
SiIV (1394/1403), and weaker lines of NV (1239/1243), CII (1335),
SiII (1527), AlII (1671).  We therefore infer z=3.956 as the redshift of 
the burst.

We note that there also appears to be an intervening system at z=2.686.

I re-observed the afterglow candidate of GRB 140428A in longslit mode

taken using the 400/8500 grating (red camera) and 600/4000 grism (blue 
camera).

In a provisional reduction, the spectrum of the object shows a weak, 
flat continuum between 7000 Angstroms and the red limit of the 
wavelength range at approximately 10100 Angstroms.  The flux sharply 
drops to zero at 7000 angstroms, though there is faint flux detected in 
some places slightly further to the blue.  No trace is detected on the

""Starting on October 05 2002 01:37 UT we have obtained high resolution
spectra (R=50,000, 6 km/s in the observer frame) of the optical
afterglow of GRB021004 (Fox et al., GCN #1564) using UVES at VLT.  The
observations cover the full spectral range 3200-9800 Angstrom, in good
seeing conditions. At the time of the observations the afterglow
magnitude was R~18.6 and B~19.0.

A preliminary analysis of the first hour of observation reveals
several absorption lines associated with at least 4 metal systems
(also see Salamanca et al., GCN #1611).

The z=2.321,2.327 system is probably very close to the GRB itself or
the circumburst medium. C IV absorption lines associated with this
system are in fact extremely strong and complex, spanning a velocity
range of about 1000 km/s. This system may show the so called ""line
locking"", possibly relativistic, effect, where the second component of
the z=2.321 C IV doublet is ""locked"" to the first component of the
z=2.327 C IV doublet. This effect has been observed in the past in
narrow absorption systems associated with high redshift quasars (e.g.
Wampler 1991, ApJ, 368, 40) and O stars (Lucy & Solomon, 1970, ApJ,
159, 879).

Low ionization lines of AlII1670 and possibly SiII1526 are also
detected in the red wing of the z=2.327 component. Low ionization
lines are not detected in the lower redshift system at z=2.321.

The z=2.2958,2.2985 system is shifted by ~2500 km/s blueward of the
strong z=2.321,2.327 system and shows much weaker, but still very
strong, C IV lines and no low ionization lines. The velocity range of
this absorption is of about 300 km/s.

The z=1.6019 intervening system shows a narrow Al III absorption with
column density of log N(AlIII)=13.2 +\- 0.1 and Doppler parameter b=12
+\- 1 km/s.

The other system at z=1.38 shows a complex structure with at least 4
components spanning a velocity range of about 200 km/s.  The FeII
column densities suggest that this system may be associated with a
Damped Lyman Alpha system in the interstellar medium of an intervening
galaxy.""

(UCI) report:

On the night of 2014-06-07 starting at 19:16 (UT) we acquired two 900 
second optical spectra of iPTF14bfu (Singer et al., GCN 16360), an 
optical transient in the error circle of GRB 140606B / Fermi 432717114 
(Burns et al., GCN 16360), with the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck II 
10 meter telescope.

In the reduced spectrum of this object we identify emission lines from 
OII, OIII (5007) and H-alpha, as well as absorption features from Ca II 
(H+K), at a consistent redshift of z = 0.384.  A serendipitous galaxy 
offset by ~2 arcseconds (10 kpc) along the slit shows the same emission 
lines at identical redshift but no detectable continuum.

Given this redshift, the high luminosity inferred for the optical 
transient at the time of the initial detection (absolute magnitude ~ 
-21.7) favors the association of this source as the optical afterglow of

of any signal in the UVB arm, but a clear trace, albeit with moderate

OSIRIS at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Observations consisted of
z-band imaging, and spectroscopy using the R1000R grism (covering from
5100 to 10000 A with a resolution of ~1000). The spectroscopic observations
were delayed due to bad weather and had a mean epoch of 6:12 UT (3.59 
hours after the burst), and consisted of 2x900s exposures. Conditions were 
not optimal, as the airmass at that time was ~1.8 and most of the observation
was performed during twilight.

The spectrum shows a low S/N continuum, which is however, visible
between 5100 and 9500 A. Some absorption features seem to be present,
and in particular we identify a broad feature at 5300 A, with an observed
equivalent width of ~30 A. This could correspond to a weak Ly-alpha
(log(N_H/cm^-2) ~< 20) absorption at z=3.35. However, no other features
corresponding to that same redshift are seen, which is not unexpected for
a low density line of sight that would correspond to such a Ly-alpha feature
and a low S/N spectrum. Further absorptions could correspond to intervening
MgII absorbers.

This redshift solution is supported by the photometric drop seen by GROND
in the g-band (Varela et al. GCN 16953), which would correspond to a similar
photometric redshift.",3.35,GRB 141026A,OSIRIS at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias,Spectroscopic

""We obtained imaging and spectroscopy of GRB 150101B/Swift J123205.1-105602 (Cummings et al. ATel 6871) with the ESO VLT on 4 Jan 2015, beginning at approximately 06:40 UT. At this epoch 1280s of I-band and1080s of z-band observations were obtained with FORS2 in ~1"" seeing. The known galaxy, 2MASX J12320498-1056010, is clearly detected in these images, and its light extends under the position of the candidate optical counterpart reported by Fong et al. (GCN 17271). We do not detect any point source at this location, although the combination of differing seeing, band and the underlying host galaxy mean that we cannot make any strong statements about the variability of the source. We additionally note that the 90% confidence of the refined XRT position (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_live_cat/00020464/) currently includes the nucleus of 2MASX J12320498-1056010, but not the source identified by Fong et al. 

In addition we obtained spectroscopic observations of 2MASX J12320498-1056010, covering the wavelength range 5300-8500A. The continuum is well detected across this wavelength range, with several prominent absorption features, most notably Mg b, and Na D at a preliminary redshift of z=0.134. We do not see any emission lines, although H-beta, [OIII] (4959,5007) and H-alpha all fall within our wavelength range at this redshift. We are not sensitive to the line identified by Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN 17278) as [OII] at z=0.093 since it lies blueward of our spectrum, but note that z=0.093 is not consistent with the observed absorption features. The absence of emission lines implies that the galaxy is a passive system. With an absolute magnitude of M_K ~ -25.5 (Vega), it lies the bright end of the luminosity function.

The properties of the galaxy are broadly similar to those of some short-GRBs (most notably GRB 050509B, Gehrels et al. 2005 Nature 437 851; Fong et al. 2013 ApJ 769 56). At z=0.134 the isotropic energy release, E_iso, would be approximately 1e48 erg, again in the energy range seen for other short-GRBs. However, the soft gamma-ray spectrum of the prompt emission is unusual, as is the long lived X-ray emission of the potential counterpart. The X-rays persist for several days post burst, at a luminosity of approximately 2e43 ergs/s. This is typical of an AGN, but such bright sources are unusual in the small BAT error box. The log(N)-log(S) of  Manners et al. (2003 MNRAS 343 293), predicts <10 sources of this flux or brighter per square degree (<~0.05 in a region the size of the BAT error box).  Furthermore, the optical spectrum does not show obvious signs of AGN activity. Hence it is likely, but not yet conclusive, that the X-ray source, and galaxy are associated with GRB 150101B/Swift J123205.1-105602.

If associated with a short-GRB we might expect the development of kilonova emission over the next few days which may peak at a H-band magnitude of around H(AB)=22-23, if similar to that seen in GRB 130603B (Tanvir et al. 2013 Nature 500 547, Berger et al. 2013 ApJ 774 23). Alternatively, the soft gamma-ray emission, prolonged X-rays, and location close to the nucleus of its host galaxy could be indicative of an unusual AGN outburst or tidal disruption flare.

We have determined that the slit position used in the VLT service
observations of GRB 021211, reported in GCN 1756, was 1 to 1.5
arcseconds East of the expected position due to the saturation of the
offset star in the acquisition images. The position angle of the slit
was zero degrees, i.e. aligned along the North-South direction, the
seeing during the observations was 0.65"", and the slit width was 1"".

Consequently, the object 1.5"" to the North-East of the afterglow (see
GCNs 1759, 1750, 1758, 1765), is by accident mostly contained within
the slit, while the emission from the position of the afterglow is not
or only partly. Therefore, the reported redshift most likely belongs
to the galaxy 1.5"" away from the transient, as suggested by Caldwell
and colleagues (GCN 1759). Future observations are needed to prove or
disprove that this galaxy is in fact the GRB host.",0.168,GRB 021211,Very Large Telescope (VLT),Spectroscopic

We performed the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis of
GRB 150413A
(Swift/BAT trigger #637899: Markwardt et al., GCN Circ. 17688; Stamatikos
et al., GCN Circ. 17701).
Since the Konus-Wind observed this GRB in the waiting mode, we only have 3
channel spectral data for
the Konus-Wind which cover the energy range from 20 keV to 1.2 MeV.

The joint spectral analysis of the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data
allows us
to derive the broad-band spectral parameters of this burst.

The time intervals of the spectral data for each instrument are chosen
from T0(BAT)-102.150 s to T0(BAT)+159.866 s (the time-integrated spectrum)
and from T0(BAT)+95.098 s to T0(BAT)+118.650 s (the spectrum of the most
prominent pulse)
where T0(BAT) is the trigger time of BAT at 13:54:58 UTC.

The energy ranges which we used in the joint spectral analysis are 20-1200
keV and 15-150 keV
for the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of
two instruments
are fitted with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to
take into account
the systematic effective area uncertainties in the response matrices of
each instrument.

The spectrum of the most prominent pulse is well fitted with
a power-law with exponential cutoff model: dN/dE ~
E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak).
No systematic residual from the best fit model is seen in the spectral
data of each instrument.

The BAT constant factor is  0.71(-0.12,+0.16) (the KW constant factor is
fixed to 1).
The best fit spectral parameters are:
alpha = -1.01(-0.44,+0.65), and
Epeak = 96(-22,+56) keV (chi2/dof = 60/57).

The best fit spectral parameters for the GRB (Band) model fixing beta =
-2.5 are:
alpha =  -1.00(-0.51,+0.84), and
Epeak = 91(-26,+77) keV
(chi2/dof = 63/57).

The time-integrated spectrum is well fitted with a power-law model
with the the photon index 1.77(-0.09,+0.09), chi2/dof = 68/58.
The BAT constant factor is  0.70(-0.09,+0.11) (the KW constant factor is
fixed to 1).
The energy fluence in the 15-1200 keV band calculated by a power-law model
for this 262.016 s interval is 1.42(-0.19,+0.20)x10^-5 erg/cm2.

Assuming a redshift of 3.139 (de Ugarte Postigo and Tomasella, GCN Circ.
17710)
and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 67.3 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.315,
Omega_Lambda = 0.685,
the isotropic energy release in the 1 keV - 10 MeV energy range is

On the night of 29/30 December 2002, the field of GRB 021211 was
re-observed in spectroscopic mode with FORS2 at unit-4 of ESO's VLT at
Paranal, Chile. The total exposure time was 30 min in the 300V grism,
covering approximately 4000-9300A with a resolution of about 12A. The
slit, with a width of 1"", was positioned to cover the position of the
probable host galaxy, as well as the galaxy 1.5"" to the North-East
(see Fruchter et al., GCN 1781). The seeing during the observations
was ~0.7"".

Preliminary reduction of these spectra confirm that the redshift of
the nearby galaxy is z=0.800+-0.001 (see Vreeswijk et al., GCN
1767). Due to a reference star also being in the slit, there is no
ambiguity in the identification of this galaxy as the source of these
emission lines (again [OII] and [OIII]).

At the position of the probable host, we find one clear emission line
at 7476A with an observed equivalent width of 66 +- 8 A (Poisson error
only). The continuum level just redward of the line is similar to that
on the blue side, suggesting that the line is not Lyman alpha. The
most likely identification is [OII] 3727A at a redshift of z=1.006. At
this redshift, other prominent emission lines such as Hbeta and [OIII]
5007A fall outside our spectral coverage. If the line were Halpha, we
would have expected to see [OII] and [OIII] in the blue part of the
spectra, which we do not detect. An alternative identification of the
emission line is [OIII] 5007A, which would put the host at z=0.493. 
However, in this case we would have expected to also detect [OII]
(although it would be very close to a bright sky line), assuming that
its flux would be more than about half the flux of [OIII] 5007A.

The [OII] at z=1.006 identification is strengthened by flux
calibration of the spectra, which shows a drop of about 1 magnitude
between the 8000-9000A continuum and that blueward of the emission
line. This is consistent with the red HST V-I colour reported by
Fruchter et al., and with the possibility that this colour is caused
by the 4000A break.

The continuum is faint with no clear absorption lines, but can be traced in the blue as far as the instrumental cut-off at about 3100A.

Following the detection of GRB 150818A by Swift/BAT (D Elia et al. 2015,
GCNC 18152), we have obtained an optical spectrum (2 x 900s) with the
10.4m GTC telescope (+OSIRIS) in La Palma (Spain), starting on Aug 18,
22:05 UT (i.e. 10.5 hr postburst), covering the 3700-7800 A wavelength
range. The slit included the position of the proposed optical afterglow
(Marshall and D Elia, GCNC 18155; Schulze et al., GCNC 18164; Mazaeva et
al. GCNC 18175).

At the position of the optical afterglow, we see no obvious absorption
features with the continuum extending from 3700 to 7800 A. However we
clearly detect emission lines of [OII] 3727A, H-beta and [OIII]
4960A,5008A, all at a common redshift z = 0.282. Indeed a diffuse object
seems to be adjacent (within 1 to the west) to the optical afterglow in
the acquisition image (under 0.7 seeing), which could be the host galaxy
at the above mentioned redshift.

Further spectroscopy and monitoring at all wavelengths is encouraged to
search for the emergence of the underlying supernova component in the next
weeks.",0.282,GRB 150818A,10.4m GTC telescope (+OSIRIS),Spectroscopic

In the GCN 18263 (Levan et al. 2015), the galaxy NGC 3313 (z=0.0124, d=54 Mpc), which lies within the detection horizon of Advanced-LIGO/VIRGO, is presumed to be the host galaxy of GRB 150906B. Consequently, the isotropic energy of GRB 150906B is inferred Eiso~10^{49} erg. In the GCN 18259 (Golenetskii et al., 2015) from Konus-Wind, the time-averaged spectrum of GRB 150906B fitted by a cutoff power law gives the peak energy Ep = 928(-95,+111) keV in the observer's frame.

From previous GRB statistics (see attached figure [1] and ref. [2]), a typical short GRB with Ep~1 MeV corresponds to Eiso~10^{51} erg. With a fluence of 2.8(-0.2,+0.2)x10^{-5} erg/cm2 from GCN 18259, the redshift of GRB 150906B is expected to be z > 0.06 (266 Mpc), most probably z~0.12 (555 Mpc). Therefore the host galaxy of GRB 150906B could be one of the others nearby.

This type of short GRBs with Eiso < 10^{52} erg originate from merging neutron stars (NSs) leading to a massive NS and not to a black hole [3]. In view of the small value of the energetic, we indicate these sources as short gamma-ray flash (SGRF). As opposed to the more energetic short gamma-ray bursts, the SGRFs never have GeV emission.

We suggest that this is the optical afterglow of GRB 151021A and we measure

USNO-B1.0 catalogue. An object at consistent coordinates is also visible in the

derived from the minima of the Ca II (rest 395.1 nm) and Na I D (rest
589.3 nm) lines are 12 000 km/s and 11 700 km/s, respectively.  At 4

Swift BAT triggered on the early activity of GRB 151027A (Maselli et
al. 2015, GCN 18478). Swift XRT started observing 87 s after the
trigger observing the main event. By using the Swift/XRT spectrum
repository at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/ (see Evans et al.
2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177) we selected a time interval with an almost
constant hardness ratio, starting at 150 s after the burst onset
and lasting 281 s. We then fit the Window Timing (WT) spectrum with
XSPEC using the model tbabs*ztbabs*pow.
We assume a Galactic column density of 3.75x10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et
al. 2013, MNRAS, 431, 394) and we allow for a 30% uncertainty in the fit.
We fit the spectrum using C-statistics (C-stat=593.74 with 637 d.o.f.).
In the intrinsic column density vs. redshift plane there is just one 
deep minimum
hinting for a redshift z=0.38+/-0.17 (90% confidence level) and an
intrinsic column density N_H(z)=(3.6+/-0.7)x10^21 cm^-2.
The X-ray spectrum is soft with Gamma=2.6, (assuming a cut-off power
law spectrum the allowed redshift range expands to 0.27-1.38).

beginning at 08:00 UT on Feb 26, which provides a high-resolution
(R~5,000) spectrum with high S/N.  In a preliminary analysis of the

z=1.043.  The two higher-redshift systems have been reported
independently by Greiner et al. (GCN 1886), expanding on the initial

The two higher-redshift systems exhibit very strong equivalent widths,
whereas the equivalent widths for the z=1.043 system are much weaker,
consistent with the population of field galaxy QSO absorbers.
Moreover, each of the higher-redshift systems, separated by 2300 km/s

F. Chaffee and R. Goodrich (CARA/WMKO), on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-CARA
GRB collaboration, report:

We obtained spectra of the host galaxy of GRB 980613 (see GCN Circ. 114 and
117) at the Keck-I telescope, on 17 Dec 1998 UT.  The reduced spectrum shows
a single strong emission line at 7814 Angstroms, which we interpret as the 
[O II] 3727 line at z = 1.0964 +- 0.0003, a probable 4000-A break just to
the red of it, and a very blue, featureless continuum blueward of the line.  
Other plausible spectroscopic identifications of this line (e.g., Ly alpha,
Balmer lines, [O III], etc.) would predict appearance of other strong 
emission lines or continuum breaks, which are clearly not seen in our data.  
We thus consider our redshift interpretation to be secure.  The spectrum is 
typical of star forming galaxies at comparable redshifts.

Both the continuum and the line emission are clearly extended.  The images
of the galaxy (which is coincident with the OT discovered by Hjorth et al.,
1998, GCN Circ. 109), show a patchy or asymmetric morphology, suggestive of
an interacting system.

In what follows, we assume the Galactic foreground extinction A(V) = 0.27 mag
from Schlegel et al. (1998, ApJ 500, 525), and a simple Friedman model 
cosmology with H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_0 = 0.2, and Lambda_0 = 0.  At this 
redshift, the luminosity distance is 2.256e28 cm.

The extinction-corrected spectroscopic magnitudes of the host are: B = 24.4, 
V = 24.1, and R = 23.85 mag, with the zero-point uncertain by at least 0.2 
mag.  This is in an excellent agreement with the R-band magnitude in a 
comparable aperture, derived from direct images obtained at the Keck-II 
telescope on 28 Nov 1998 UT, and consistent with our earlier estimate (GCN 
Circ. 117).  

From the BATSE fluence of 1.71e-6 erg/cm2 (Woods et al. 1998, GCN Circ. 112) 
the implied isotropic gamma-ray energy of the burst was 5.2e51 erg.

The extinction-corrected [O II] line flux is 4.4e-17 erg/cm2/s, giving the
line luminosity of 2.8e41 erg/s.  The implied unobscured SFR, using the
conversion from Kennicutt (1998, ARAA 36) is 3.9 Msun/yr.  The observed, 
extinction-corrected monochromatic flux at the rest wavelength of 2800 A is 
0.9 microJy, corresponding to the restframe power of 2.76e28 erg/s/Hz.  The 
implied unobscured SFR, using the estimator from Madau et al. (1998, ApJ 498,
106) is 3.5 Msun/yr, in an excellent agreement with the [O II] line estimate, 
although both may be uncertain by as much as 20-50%.  This agreement suggests 
that the host galaxy as a whole is not heavily obscured.  We note that this 
SFR is rather moderate, despite the very blue color of the host galaxy.

Using a 32-ms binned light curve (which is the shortest time bin
possible for the lag analysis in this case), the lag of the initial pulse

Despite the large error bars, the lag is inconsistent with zero, and thus
the lag of the initial pulse is much more consistent with those from a long
GRBs rather than short bursts (e.g., Norris et al. 2006).

Moreover, further analysis of the initial pulse intensity shows that it is
only a factor of several more intense than the extended emission in
both the 1-s binned and 32-ms binned light curves, which is much less

GCN 19126; Butler et al., GCN 19131) with ESOs Very Large Telescope  
UT2 equipped with X-shooter (Paranal Observatory, Chile). The spectra 
cover the range from 3000 to 18000 AA. Observations consisted of 4x1200s 
exposures, starting at 06:03 UT of 4 March 2016 (18.8 hr after the GRB 
onset).

The spectrum was obtained when the GRB was at r ~ 24.1 (Klose et al. 
GCN 19142) and hence the S/N is rather low, implying that no absorption 
feature can be identified. In spite of this, a trace can be seen in the 
complete UVB (3000-5600AA) and VIS (5600-10100 AA) spectra. The 
continuum is rather blue, as already seen from multiband photometry 
(Butler et al., GCN 19131; Graham et al., GCN 19144). The detection of the 
trace down to 3000 AA implies a redshift limit of < 2.3 (considering that the 
Lyman break is not within the range).

In spite of the deep spectrum, we have not been able to identify any emission 
feature, which could be indicative of a very faint galaxy and/or a non star 
forming galaxy (which would be expected for a SGRB).

We re-observed the field of GRB 160228A (Swift-trigger 676595,
Malesani et al. GCN #19107) with GROND mounted at the 2.2m MPG
telescope at ESO La Silla observatory. Simultaneous observations
in seven filters (g'r'i'z'JHK) started at 01:13 UT on 2016-03-03
(80 h after the GRB) and consisted of images with a total
integration time of 72 minutes in g'r'i'z' and 60 minutes in JHK.

The source reported as candidate afterglow in our earlier imaging
(Delvaux et al. GCN #19114) has faded beyond the detection limit
of the new data (r' > 25.1 mag in the AB system), confirming it
as the optical afterglow of GRB 160228A.

The nearby source (angular separation of 1.7"") mentioned in
Delvaux et al. (GCN #19114) is still clearly present and located
at

RA (J2000.0) = 07:09:15.79
Dec. (J2000.0) = +26:55:52.4

with a preliminary brightness of r' = 24.2 +/- 0.3 mag.

The chance coincidence probability of finding an unrelated object
of this magnitude within a distance of 1.7"" is 0.04
(following Bloom et al. 2002, AJ, 123, 1111), and we hence
consider this object as a host galaxy candidate of GRB 160228A.
While the chance coincidence probability is quite low, we note
that the angular separation would be unusually large for long GRBs.

A spectrum of the possible host was taken on 2016-03-12 with the VLT
equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. The spectrum covers
the wavelength range 3000-20000 AA and has an exposure time of
4x1200 s.  In the red part of the spectrum, we detect two emission
lines which we interpret as [O III] (5007) and Halpha at a common
redshift z = 1.64.

A preliminary analysis of the spectrum shows several emission features at the position of the optical transient (Siegel and D'Elia, GCN 19187; Malesani et al.

In the acquisition image, we identify the afterglow proposed by Golkhou 
et al. (GCN 19236) and later also observed by Zheng & Filippenko (GCN 
19242). At the time of our observation, the object was at a magnitude 
of i(AB) = 23.89 +/-0.12 (as compared to nearby SDSS stars), with 
coordinates of (J2000.0, +/-0.5""):

R.A.: 09:46:48.56
Dec.: +54:00:46.3

We also note the presence of two other sources within 2.5 of the GRB 
afterglow: The first one is located at 09:46:48.35, +54:00:47.8 and has a 
magnitude of i(AB) = 23.76+/-0.11, and the second one is at 09:46:48.55,

these sources may be contributing to the magnitudes given by Golkhou

Spectroscopy of the GRB afterglow and the first of the two other objects 
was obtained by exposing 3x1200 s with grism R1000R, which covers 
between 5100 and 10100 Angstrom. We detect a trace of the GRB 
afterglow above 7300 AA, below which the emission drops abruptly. The 
other object shows a continuum over the complete spectral range, 
suggesting that this object is unrelated to the GRB. The afterglow 
spectrum is indicative of a Lyman-alpha drop at a redshift between 4.90 
and 5.01, with a most probable value at z = 4.99, although even lower 
redshifts could not be discarded for unusually large Hydrogen column 
densities. Due to the low S/N of the spectrum we are not able to confirm

Moradi, M. Muccino, A.V. Penacchioni, G.B. Pisani, D. Primorac, J.
Rueda, Y. Wang report:


From preliminary data of GRB 160521B detected by the Fermi satellite (Yu
& Veres, GCN 19443) and from the presence of both gamma-ray (Fermi-GBM,
8 keV - 40 MeV) and GeV emission (Fermi-LAT, 0.1-100 GeV, see Axelsson
et al., GCN 19444) it is likely that this source is a Binary driven
Hypernova (BdHN) at very high redshift.

Following Ruffini et al. 2016 (arXiv:1602.02732), it lies in the BdHN
region of the Ep-Eiso plane for selected values of the redshift above
0.5 (see purple filled circles in Fig.[1]). The observed GeV emission
implies that the source cannot be a XRF.

The current paucity of data of the X-ray afterglow (Page et al., GCN
19448) is surprising and should be further examined up to late times
taking as an example GRB 090423 at z = 8.

Assuming that GRB 160521B is actually a BdHN, we can test the overlap of
its X-ray flux with the prototypical BdHN sources (see Pisani et al.
2013, A&A, 552, L5). In Fig.[2] it is plotted the single available data
point (Page et al., GCN 19448), not yet observed dimming, of GRB 160521B
X-ray luminosity, assuming 20 different values of the redshift from 0.5
(the lowest blue point) to 10 (the highest one) in steps of 0.5.

From these preliminary data, GRB 160521B is a BdHN with possible
redshift z > 2.5 all the way up to z ~ 10, assuming that the single
observed X-ray data point belongs to the afterglow. A deep search for
the afterglow in the X-ray band is indeed crucial to define the nature
of this source.

COSI is a large field of view (1/4-sky) gamma-ray (0.1-10 MeV) instrument on 
a Superpressure Balloon flight that began on May 16.  

A likely Gamma-ray Burst (GRB 160530A) was detected by COSI in both the 
cesium iodide shields and the germanium strip detectors (GeDs).  The GRB 
started at 2016 May 30, 07:03:46 UT and lasted until 07:04:23 UT (based on 
the shield rates).  During the burst, the light curve shows several large amplitude 
fluctuations.

Based on the GeD rates and assuming a Band function with alpha=1.0, 
beta=2.5, and E_break = 150 keV, we calculated a preliminary burst fluence of 
1.3E-5 erg/cm2.  This value may be revised in the future using the spectral 
capabilities of the GeDs.

The position of the GRB is R.A. = 120.2 deg, Decl. = -26.2 deg (J2000, 90% 
confidence error radius = 1.5 degrees), which corresponds to Galactic coordinates 
of l = 243.9 deg, b = 2.1 deg.  Due to the proximity to the Galactic plane, a Galactic 
origin cannot be ruled out.

gamma-ray sources are present in the COSI error region:  GRB 080516, 
2FGL J0758.0-2615c, and 3FGL J0755.2-2633 are, respectively, 0.4, 0.6, and

(March 24/25) in spectroscopic mode with FORS2 at unit-4 of ESO's VLT
at Paranal, Chile. The total exposure time was 1 hour in the 300V and
300I grisms, covering approximately 4000-9300 A with a resolution of
about 12 A. The slit (1"" wide) was positioned to cover the position of
the presumed afterglow (Gilmore, Kilmartin & Henden, GCN 1949; see
also GCN 1952), as well as a nearby reference object.

Preliminary reduction of the 300V spectra of the candidate afterglow
shows very strong absorption over the range 516-545 nm, presumably a
complex of Ly alpha clouds around z = 3.3-3.4. The detection of
numerous narrow lines is consistent with this interpretation: we can
identify these with metal-absorption lines (SiII, OI, CII, SiIV, CIV,
AlII) at a redshift of z = 3.372. These Ly alpha and metal-absorption
lines probably originate in the host galaxy of GRB 030323.

We observed the field of GRB 160623A (Vianello et al., GCN 19553; 
Frederiks et al., GCN 19554; Mailyan et al., GCN 19555) with the Nordic 
Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the AlFOSC imager. Our 
observations had a mid time 2016 July 8.09 UT (14.88 days after the GRB 
trigger) and consisted of 6x300 s in the SDSS i filter.

Close to the position of the optical and X-ray afterglow (Mingo et al., 
GCN 19558; Pozanenko et al., GCN 19561; Butler et al., GCN 19567), we 
detect a bright source at the following coordinates (J2000):

RA = 21:01:11.65
Dec = +42:13:15.0

We measure I = 20.6 +- 0.2 (Vega) against several nearby USNO stars 
(error dominated by the calibration). To determine the relation of this 
object with the GRB afterglow, we cross-registered our image with those 
from RATIR (Butler et al., GCN 19567), yielding an RMS of 0.02"". We find 
that the NOT source is offset to the SE of the afterglow by 0.7"". This 
source could thus be the host galaxy or an unrelated, foreground star. 
We also note some faint emission in the RATIR image at the NOT 
coordinates, despite being blended with the brighter afterglow.

A picture showing the comparison of the two images is shown here:

http://www.astro.ku.dk/~malesani/GRB/160623A/GRB160623A_NOT_RATIR.png

A spectrum (3x1200 s exposure) was acquired using the Gran Telescopio 
Canarias (GTC) equipped with OSIRIS, covering the wavelength range 
5100-10,000 AA (grism R1000R), starting on 2016 July 10.163 UT (16.95 
days after the GRB). The slit was centered at the coordinates of the NOT 
object, but also partially overlapped with the afterglow location.

We detect continuum over the whole wavelength range and two emission 
lines in the red part of the spectrum, which we interpret as Halpha and 
[N II] at a common redshift z = 0.367. At the same redshift we also 
detect weak [O III] 5008 (dimmed by the large foreground extinction). 
This is most likely the redshift of GRB 160623A.

The source detected in the NOT image is possibly a foreground star (the 
Galactic latitude is b = -2.7 deg). In the GTC acquisition image, the 
object is pointlike with a seeing of 1.2"". On the other hand, inspecting 
the 2D spectrum, the spatial profile of the emission lines is different 
from that of the continuum: the features are wider and elongated towards 
the position of the afterglow. A compact host cannot however be excluded.

At z = 0.367, a SN as bright as SN 1998bw would only reach a peak 
magnitude of I ~ 24.8 (Vega) given the large Galactic extinction (A_I = 
2.2 mag; Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). From ground, such a SN would be 
difficult to distinguish against the brighter foreground object.

particular Roi Alonso and Diego Hidalgo) and at the GTC.",0.367,GRB 160623A,GTC,Spectroscopic

Following the detection of GRB 160623A by Fermi (Vianello et al. GCNC 
19553) and Konus-Wind (Frederiks et al. GCNC 19554), we observed the 
optical afterglow of GRB 160623A (Pozanenko et al. GCNC 19561) with the 
10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), gathering spectra at different 
epochs: June 25 (1.9 days post-burst) and July 3/4, with both the R1000B 
and R2500I grisms covering the range 3800-10000 A. At the position of 
the afterglow, the reddest spectrum (2 x 1200s with R2500I) showed 
H-alpha and [SII] in emission, from which we determine a redshift z = 
0.367, confirming the value proposed by Malesani et al. (GCNC 19708). 
The bluest range spectrum (1200s) also revealed a marginal detection of 
H-beta (taking into account the high foreground Galactic extinction in 
the line of sight). The faint continuum on the first epoch spectrum 
extended down to 3800 A with no absorption lines being present. 
Therefore we propose this is the redshift of the GRB 160623A host 
galaxy.

Observations were obtained in the r and z bands. The candidate afterglow (Xu et al. GCN 19834) is present in our images, but has faded by approximately a factor of two between the two epochs taken approximately one day apart. This variability confirms the source as the afterglow of GRB 160821B. 

In addition we obtained a spectrum of the candidate host galaxy (Xu et al. GCN 19834). Several prominent emission lines are visible, including Hbeta, [OIII] (4959/5007) and H-alpha, at a provisional redshift of z=0.16. 

The offset of the afterglow from the candidate host galaxy is approximately 5.5, corresponding to a physical offset of 15 kpc. While we cannot rule out a chance alignment of the afterglow with the host galaxy, we also note that the galaxy light does apparently extend to approximately the afterglow position.

We observed the field of GRB 1601001A (Page et al., GCN 19967) with the 
ESO Very Large Telescope Unit 2 (Kueyen) equipped with the X-shooter 
spectrograph.

Close to, but outside, the enhanced XRT position (Osborne et al., GCN 
19969), in our acquisition image we detect a bright, pointlike source at 
coordinates RA = 04:47:40.71, Dec = -57:15:36.8. This source is faintly 
visible in the archival DSS data and is pointlike in our images (0.75"" 
seeing).

A spectrum was secured of this object, for a total of 4x600 s, starting 
on Oct 1.299 UT (6.1 hr after the GRB). The continuum is consistent with 
a stellar spectrum, and we conclude that this target is not associated 
with GRB 161001A.

Our slit, at a position angle of 319.6 deg (CCW from north), does 
however cover a portion of the XRT error circle. Within the wings of the 
the PSF of the DSS object, approximately 0.8 arcsec SE, we detect a 
number of emission lines which are consistent with [O II], Hbeta, [O 
III] and Halpha at a common redshift of z = 0.891, revealing the 
presence of a background object. While we cannot accurately determine 
its position from the slit information alone, that is consistent with 
being at the edge of the XRT error circle. Our images also hint a faint 
extension of the DSS object at a position consistent with that of the 
emission lines, which could represent the continuum emission of the 
object. As such, this is a candidate host galaxy of GRB 161001A.

We caution that we have no way to confirm the association between the 
emission line object and the GRB. No variability can be inferred from 
our data, and as we lack an estimate of the continuum flux, we can not 
presently quantify the chance association probability.

Spectra of the optical afterglow of GRB 030329 (Peterson & Price,
GCN 1985; Torii: GCN 1986) were obtained with the
Magellan 6.5-m Clay telescope and LDSS2 imaging/spectrograph
starting at March 30.06 (UT). The spectra cover the wavelength
range of 4000 to 9000 Ang. with a resolution of 13 Ang. FWHM.
Preliminary analysis of the spectum of this bright GRB afterglow
shows a smooth blue continuum with no significant absorption
features. The only obvious feature is an unresolved emission
line at 5852 Ang. If this is [OII] emission from the host galaxy,
then the redshift is z=0.57. Further analysis is continuing.

(R~1000) spectra of the optical afterglow of GRB030329 (Peterson &
Price GCN #1985, Torii, GCN #1986) using DOLORES at TNG.  Observations
consisted of two exposures of 15 min each the second obtained at 2.75hh 
after the first, and cover  the full spectral range 3800-8000 Angstrom, 
in relatively good seeing conditions (1.5"").  At the time of the 
observations the afterglow magnitude was R~15-16 (e.g. Martini et al.
GCN #2012).
 
A preliminary analysis of the spectra reveals no strong absorption
features. A more detailed analysis is needed to search for faint
absorption lines.  A faint emission line at 5846 Angstrom (see Martini
et al. GCN# 2013) is present in the later spectra, when the afterglow
emission was less strong. If this is [OII] emission from the host
galaxy, then the redshift is z=0.568.

We detect a strong spectral variability between the first spectrum, 
when the afterglow was extremely blue, and the second spectrum, 
obtained starting from 03:25:35 UT.

mounted on the Magellan/Baade 6.5-m telescope at a mid-time of 2016 Nov
7.170 UT (2.77 days post-burst). We obtained 6x360-sec of r-band exposures
in 1.0"" seeing at an airmass of 1.3. We clearly detect the four optical
sources reported from GROND (Nicuesa Guelbenzu et al.; GCN 20132) and
Gemini (Troja et al.; GCN 20137) imaging. Given the relatively poor seeing,
accurate photometry of the individual sources is challenging. However, the
sources appear to have similar relative flux levels as previously reported,
suggesting a lack of significant variability in any of these sources. We
note that Source A (Nicuesa Guelbenzu et al.; GCN 20132) is fully
coincident with the latest XRT position*, while the three remaining sources
are on the outskirts of the position.

In addition, we obtained 3x1800-sec of spectroscopy with Magellan/IMACS on
2016 Nov 8 UT in 0.6"" seeing at an airmass of 1.1.  We used the 200 line
grism and the f/2 camera to cover 4000-10000 Angstroms. The slit was
aligned through Sources A and B (Nicuesa Guelbenzu et al.; GCN 20132) and
also serendipitously passed through a nearby extended source 6.1"" from the
center of the XRT position (Source X; RA=5:11:34.77, Dec=-51:27:41.8). The
spectrum of Source A exhibits a red continuum indicative of an early-type
galaxy with prominent Ca II H+K stellar absorption lines at z=0.793. Source
B has a faint trace with a single possible emission line of unknown
identification near 9780 Angs. The spectrum of Source X is also that of an
early-type galaxy at z=0.788. We note that both Sources A and X lack
prominent emission lines of either [O II] 3727 or H-beta.  The similarity
in the redshifts of Sources A and X, their early-type galaxy spectra, and
the abundance of extended sources in the vicinity of the XRT position may
signify an origin from a cluster or group.

In the acquisition image, taken on 2016 Nov 17.097 UT (0.73 hr after the 
GRB), the optical afterglow is clearly detected with a magnitude R ~ 19 
(assuming R = 18.10 for the USNO star at RA = 21:28:14.70, Dec = 
-29:37:08.8). The seeing was very poor, around 2.5"", and the sky 
conditions were partially cloudy.

Four spectra by 600 s each were collected covering the full X-shooter 
wavelength range 3000-25,000 AA. A faint trace is detected, down to at 
least 3800 . Superimposed on it, we are able to identify a number of 
absorption features which we interpret as due to Mg I, Mg II, and Fe II, 
all at a common redshift z = 1.549.

UVES spectrograph at the VLT unit Kueyen, starting around March 30.166 UT.
Quick-look analysis reveals several absorption and emission lines.
In particular, we find emission lines at 5680, 5850, and 7669 A
which we identify with Hbeta, [OIII]5007 and Halpha. Absorption lines
are clearly seen at 3270 A and 3334 A which we identify as the MgI 2853 and

of z=0.1685.  This is nearest GRB so far (except GRB 980425/SN1998bw),

We report on further analysis of our data (Malesani et al., GCN 20260) 
taken at the Nordic Optical Telescope for GRB 161214B (D'Avanzo et al., 
GCN 20257). The best-seeing images (~0.9"") clearly reveal two blended 
objects within the XRT error circle, separated by <1 arcsec, with 
comparable brightness (at ~2.2 hr after the GRB). As first suggested in 
GCN 20260, the likely interpretation is the near-superposition of the 
afterglow of GRB 161214B and an unrelated, foreground object. 
Astrometric registration of our images with the SDSS frames shows that 
the afterglow is slightly south of the SDSS source.

A spectrum of the complex was secured using the AlFOSC spectrograph, 
covering both objects. Observations started on 2016 Dec 14.82 UT (2.42 
hr after the GRB) and consisted of 2x20 min exposures using grism #4, 
covering the wavelength range 3500-9400 AA. A few absorption lines are 
apparent, and there is a hint that their spatial extent on the trace is 
offset to the North (consistent with the SDSS source location). The two 
most prominent features can be identified as the Mg I b triplet and the 
Na I D doublet at redshift ~0, confirming that the SDSS object is a 
Galactic star (probably of K or early M type). One more feature is 
observed at ~4238 AA, whose identification is unclear. One possibility 
is the Ca I 4226 A resonant line at z = 0, sometimes observed in K 
stars, which would however require an offset of the wavelength 
calibration in the blue part of our spectrum.

No features which can be clearly attributed to the afterglow are 
detected in our spectrum. Marshall & D'Avanzo (GCN 20268) report 
detection of the afterglow in the UVOT UVW2 filter, at a flux level much 
brighter than the SDSS object (u ~ 22.5). This allows to set an upper 
limit to the redshift z <~ 1.2 from the absence of the Lyman limit dropout.",~0,GRB 161214B,Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT),Spectroscopic

The low-resolution spectra cover the wavelength

shows several narrow emission lines. The line seen at
5852 Ang. by Martini et al. (GCN 2013) and Della Ceca et al.
(GCN 2015) is, in fact, [OIII] 5007 and confirms the redshift
estimate of Greiner et al. (GCN 2020) of z=0.168.

In a 1.25"" wide slit we find the following observed fluxes:

A narrow absorption line is detected at 3933.2 Ang. 
with an equivalent width of 0.4 Ang. and is probably
due to CaII in our Galaxy.

An estimate of the star formation rate in the 4 kpc
of the host galaxy nearest the burst can be made
from the [OII] luminosity (Kennicutt 1998, ARAA, 36, 189;
assuming H0=72).  The rate is an anemic ~0.1 Solar masses/yr.
without correcting for host extinction. The Halpha/Hbeta
ratio is not well determined from these data, but does not
imply a large extinction. We therefore conclude that the
SFR of the GRB 030329 host is very low.

Our spectrum has a low signal-to-noise ratio with no signal being
detected bluewards of around 5800 AA due to a combination of
high background from the bright moon and faint afterglow.
In the red part, the spectrum exhibits four marginal absorption
features, which are consistent with coming from various FeII

report:

We have analyzed the full 94.0 ksec (livetime) Chandra LETGS 
observation of GRB030328 (Villasenor et al, GCN1978), lasting from 
March 29.112 (t[burst] + 15.33 hr) until March 30.278 (t[burst] + 
43.32 hr).  The mean counting rate for the X-ray afterglow (Butler et 
al. GCN2007) is 0.012 counts/s (summed over the dispersed signal from 
the LETGS, and including the 0th order flux).  We observe that the 
brightness over the full observation decays with a slope -1.5 +/- 
0.1, consistent with the value reported by Ford et al. (GCN2027). 
(The chi^2 is 34.27 for 30 degrees of freedom, and the fit is 
rejectable at only 73% confidence.)  We see no evidence for a 
temporal break.  We fit the dispersed LETGS counts (+/-1 orders 
summed) and the counts in 0th order jointly by minimizing chi^2, 
requiring 12 or more counts per spectral bin.  In the 0.5 to 3.0 keV 
band, the data are well fit (chi^2/nu=48.45/48, rejectable at 54% 
confidence) by an absorbed power-law:

dN/dE = A * E^ (-gamma) * exp(-NH * sigma[E]) ,

where NH = ( 5 +/- 3 ) x 10^20 cm^(-2) is the line of sight column 
density, which is consistent with the anticipated galactic absorption 
in the source direction; A = ( 6.8 +/- 0.9 ) x 10^(-5) ph cm^(-2) 
s^(-1) keV^(-1); and gamma = 1.7 +/- 0.2 .  These are 1 parameter 
1-sigma confidence intervals.

Integrating the above model over the 0.5 to 3.0 keV band, the mean 
flux for the duration of the Chandra observation is ~1.9 x 10^(-13) 
ergs cm^(-2) s^(-1).

Our analyses are continuing, and more detailed results will be posted at:

In our r-band acquisition image, (30 second exposure time), we see the host
candidate of Xu et al. (GCN Circ. 21048), which is also slightly visible in
the r-band Pan-STARRS image.  The slit was centred on the host galaxy
candidate, and in the faint trace we detect emission lines corresponding to
Halpha, [OIII] 5007, Hbeta, and [OII] 3726,3729, all at a common redshift
of z=0.454.  The angular separation between the candidate host and the GRB
position determed by GROND (Bolmer et al., GCN Circ. 21050) is 1.2'' +-

We obtained spectra of the afterglow of GRB 030329 (Peterson & Price,
GCN 1985; Torii: GCN 1986) with the 6.5-m MMT and Blue-Channel
spectrograph each night from March 30.12 to April 6.15 (UT). The
spectra cover a wavelength range of 350 nm to 850 nm with a resolution
of 0.6 nm (FWHM). The early spectra consist of a power-law continuum
with narrow emission lines originating from HII regions in the host
galaxy (Martini et al. GCN 2013; Della Ceca et al. GCN 2015; Greiner
et al. GCN 2020; Caldwell et al. GCN 2053).  However, our spectrum
taken Apr. 6.15 (UT) shows a broad peak in flux at approximately 570
nm and another weak deviation from a power-law near 470nm that were
not evident in the earlier spectra.

The April 6 spectrum is well reproduced by adding a spectrum of SN
1998bw (Patat et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 900) seven days before maximum
light to a power-law distribution. We conclude that a supernova
spectrum is emerging from the afterglow light.  The brightness of the
supernova is approximately V=22 based on the strengths of the broad
features relative to a pure power-law. Further spectroscopy is
planned.

report:

We have obtained several spectra (410-900 nm, resolution 1.6 nm) of
the optical counterpart of GRB030329 (Peterson & Price, GCN 1985;
Torii: GCN 1986) with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and Marcario
Low-Resolution spectrograph. Our spectra of March 31, April 2, and
April 5 (UT) show the following evolution of the spectral properties:
(a) the equivalent widths of the [O III] and H-alpha emission lines is
increasing in a manner consistent with a constant line flux and a
decline of the continuum, and (b) the spectrum of April 5 (UT) shows
evidence of a broad feature underlying the [O III] lines, similar
tresembling that reported by Matheson et al. (GCN 2107), who interpret
it as due to an emerging SN spectrum. However, the contrast of this
feature in our spectrum is not as high as in the spectrum of Matheson
et al. (taken a day later than ours). As a consequence, we cannot rule
out alternative interpretations, such as the emergence of a host
galaxy spectrum that manifests itself as a break in the power-law
continuum.  Analysis of more recent spectra is under way to clarify
this issue.

Using the [O II] and H-alpha emission line fluxes of Caldwell et
al. (GCN 2053), we estimate luminosities of 1x10^40 and 4x10^40 erg/s,
respectively (for z=0.168, i.e., a luminosity distance of 880 Mpc),
and infer star formation rates of 0.15 and 0.32 solar masses/yr
(following Kennicutt 1998, ARAA, 36, 189). The upper limit on the host
galaxy from historical images reported by Wood-Vasey et al.  (GCN
1998; R > 22.28) implies a limit on the absolute magnitude of M_R >
-17.4, which is comparable to that of the LMC. The [OIII]/H-beta ratio
of 2.7 (Caldwell et al.; GCN 2053) corresponds to an LMC-like faint
starburst galaxy (Ho, et al. 1997, ApJ, 487, 579, Figure 6; Hunter &
Gallagher, 1997, ApJ, 475, 65; Hunter et al. 2001 ApJ, 553, 121),
while the H-alpha luminosity is characteristic of starburst galaxies
(Ho. et al. Figure 2). High-dispersion spectroscopy of these narrow
lines may give more information on the nature of star formation in the
host galaxy.",0.168,GRB030329,Hobby-Eberly Telescope,Spectroscopic

	  ftp://ftp.sao.ru/pub2/grb/GRB030329/

With consideration for z=0.168 the first spectra of the OT GRB 030329
remind the very first spectrum of SN 1987A beginning with lambda=3425A,
(Danziger et al, 1987, A&A, 177, L13; Menzies et al. 1987, MNRAS, 227, 39P)
The same spectral behaiour of OT is confirmed by simultaneous UBVRI
observations with the 1-m (Zeiss-1000) of SAO RAS
starting from March 29.717 to 30.015 (UT).
The data are being processed for more accurate calibration.

A possible interpretation (V.Sokolov):
Perhaps, such a behaviour of the very first spectra of OT GRB 030329,
as well as the case of SN 1987A, could be explained by the fact that the burst
of supernova related to the burst of a compact massive star and
recorded in the very beginning of its GRB evolution was observed
in detail for the second time. The physics of the early SN brightness peak
can be related to the exit of a shock wave (or a jet?) onto the surface
of a compact pre-supernova. (e. g. E. Grassberg, V. Imshennik and
D. Nadyozin, 1971, Astroph. Space Sci., 10, 28). Though the difference
between the types of SN 1987A and SN 2003dh (K. Stanek, T. Matheson,
P. Garnavich et al. astro-ph/0304173), and their pre-supernovae should
be certainly taken into consideration.

report:


Starting on 2003 April 2.1 (3.6 days after the GRB), we observed the 
optical counterpart (Peterson & Price, GCN 1985; Torii, GCN 1986) of GRB 
030329 (Vanderspek et al., GCN 1997). The observations were performed with 
the ESO VLT-UT1 (Antu) telescope equipped with FORS1, in 
spectropolarimetric mode. At that time, the afterglow had a magnitude V ~ 
17.7 (Covino et al., GCN 2122).

Our spectrum spans the wavelenght range 350-850 nm. Several narrow 
emission lines are clearly detected (e.g. Greiner et al., GCN 2020).

The polarization level is found very small, yet significantly nonzero, 
decreasing from (0.9+/-0.1)% in the blue to (0.5+/-0.1)% in the red part 
of the spectrum (1-sigma errors); the polarization angle also shows a 
mildly significant variation from (83+/-4) deg in the blue to (73+/-5) deg 
in the red. These trends are consistent with the effect of a mildly 
polarizing Galactic/host ISM on a intrinsically polarized afterglow.

In particular, the values we obtain in correspondence of the R-band 
(lambda ~ 650 nm) are P = (0.5+/-0.1)% and theta = (73+/-5) deg. 
Comparison of our result with previous measurements (Efimov et al., GCN 
2144; Magalhes et al., GCN 2163) might indicate some time variability on 
a few-days timescale.

Spectra of the optical afterglow of GRB 030329 (Peterson & Price, GCN
1985; Torii: GCN 1986) and supernova 2003dh (Garnavich et al.  IAUC
8114) were obtained with the 6.5-m MMT on April 24.15 (UT) and with
the Keck-II telescope and ESI spectrograph on April 24.36. Preliminary
analysis of the spectra show broad peaks at 560 nm, 450 nm and a sharp
break in the continuum at 390 nm (all in the rest frame).

The spectrum continues to closely follow the development of SN~1998bw
(Patat et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 900). The feature at 450 nm was not
present on spectra of SN 2003dh taken April 6 (Matheson et al. GCN
2107) and suggests a significantly lower photospheric velocity in the
current spectrum. SN 1998bw developed the 450 nm feature around
maximum light and this implies SN 2003dh is now at or past its
maximum.

The continuum of SN 2003dh is bluer than SN 1998bw at a similar phase,
which suggests that the afterglow light still contributes to the total
flux.

""Three 40 min spectra of GRB 990123 were obtained at NOT on Jan 24.24 UT 1999. 
Based on a preliminary reduction and analysis we detect the following 
ultraviolet absorption lines: Si II (152.6 nm), C IV (154.9 nm), Fe II 
(160.8 nm), Al II (167.1 nm), Zn II (202.6 and 206.3 nm), Fe II (234.4, 237.5, 
and 238.3 nm), and Fe II (258.7 and 260.0 nm) at a redshift of 1.600 +- 0.001. 
This value is in agreement with the redshift found by Kelson et al. (IAU Circ. 
7096).  Several additional absorption lines and two emission lines are detected.
There is one definite system at z = 0.286 +- 0.001 based on [OII] (372.7 nm) 
emission and Ca H and K (393.3 nm and 396.9 nm) absorption and another possible
system at z = 0.210 +- 0.002 based on [OII] emission and Ca K absorption.  One
of these systems are likely to be associated with the galaxy located 
1.8 +- 0.4"" from the optical transient (Bloom et al., GCN Circ. 206).  This 
galaxy has an estimated redshift of z ~ 0.2 - 0.3 (Gal et al., GCN Circ. 213). 

These observations support the idea that GRB 990123 may be a gravitationally 
lensed gamma-ray burst (Djorgovski et al. GCN Circ. 216).  The 'source' 
(optical transient) redshift (z >= 1.60) and 'lens' (galaxy) redshift(s) 
(z = 0.29, z = 0.21) as well as the angular separation between the image and 
the lens are typical of those found among multiply imaged QSOs.  The existence
of several galaxies along the line of sight to the GRB enhances the lensing
cross section. If GRB 990123 is multiply lensed, a fainter GRB is expected to 
appear 2-3"" north of GRB 990123, within a time scale of months.  In addition, 
two more GRBs may appear within days or weeks from now if GRB 990123 is 
quadruply lensed.  Continued monitoring is urged at all wavelengths in order to 
determine precise time delay(s).

The results reported in this circular are preliminary.  A more detailed
analysis is ongoing.""

""We have observed the field of GRB 030429 (=HETE trigger 2695) around
May 2.2 UT with the ESO VLT. Using FORS1 on UT1 we have obtained a 
spectrum of the optical afterglow (GCN 2184) covering 3800 - 8000 
Angstrom. In the spectrum we identify a strong damped Ly-alpha line 
around 4442 Angstrom. This implies a lower limit of z=2.65 to the 
redshift of GRB 030429. The absence of Ly-alpha forest absorption on 
the red side of the line and the seemingly very large column density 
of the line renders a higher redshift very unlikely and we therefore 
conclude that z=2.65 is the redshift of GRB 030429.

We measure a fade in the H-band flux in time as t^(-1.0+/-0.1).

Using all bands (see, Watson et al., GCN 22057), we find high A_V photo-z
solutions nearby (z<3.85, 90% conf.) and a high-z solution which assumes

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 171010A (Omodei et al., GCN 21985; Poolakkil & Meegan, GCN 21992; Sharma et al., GCN 21990) at z = 0.33 (Kankare et al., GCN 22002) using the ESO Very Large Telescope. Imaging was secured on 2017 Oct 31.25 UT (20.45 days after the GRB) using the VIMOS instrument, in the R and I filters, for a total of 10 min exposure each.

Both the candidate host galaxy of the GRB (Thorstensen & Halpern, GCN 21897; Izzo & Malesani, GCN 21988) and a second compact source, at a location consistent with that of the optical afterglow, are well visible in our images. The spatial coincidence of the second source could indicate late-time emission associated with the GRB, or the presence of an underlying star-forming region.

Spectroscopy covering both the host nucleus and the afterglow location was carried out on 2017 Nov 1.25 UT (21.46 days after the GRB; 16 days in the GRB rest frame), using the X-shooter spectrograph, for a total exposure time of 4x1200 s. The traces of both objects are visible, showing a wealth of narrow nebular emission lines, some of which especially intense at the afterglow location. We measure for the galaxy nucleus a redshift z = 0.3285, consistent with the report by Kankare et al. (GCN 22002).

Faint continuum emission is detected at the GRB location. This could be due to an associated SN, as expected for long GRBs at this redshift, or to an underlying star forming region, or a combination of both. The spectral shape is curved and redder than at the nucleus location, but extinction is low as inferred from the Balmer decrement. This opens the possibility of excess light from the SN. In the attempt to isolate its contribution, we then estimated the host contamination by rescaling the nucleus spectrum assuming it contributes the entire flux at 3500 AA (rest frame), where GRB-associated SNe have negligible emission (e.g. Hjorth et al. 2003, Nature, 423, 847; Mazzali et al. 2003, ApJ, 599, 95), due to metal line blanketing.

By comparing the residual contribution with known SN/GRB templates, we find a good resemblance with other GRB-associated SNe, such as SN 1998bw (at 6 days post maximum; e.g. Patat et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 900) and SN 2006aj (at 5 days post maximum; e.g. Pian et al., Nature, 442, 1011). Based on this resemblance, the object has been assigned the IAU name of SN 2017htp. The brightness of the SN is about 30% (1.3 mag fainter) than SN 1998bw at a comparable epoch. An accurate computation requires however a more rigorous host subtraction which will be possible with late-time templates.

Camera on the Baade 6.5 m at the Las Campanas Observatory.  The
dispersion at 7600 Angstrom (Ang) is 0.053 Ang/pixel. The narrow
emission lines (Martini et al., GCN #2013; Della Ceca et al., GCN

al., GCN #2117), presumably from the host galaxy, are well detected in
each 1800 sec exposure.  Using a fit to the H-alpha line, we find the
heliocentric systemic redshift of the host galaxy is:

         z = 0.168541 +/- 0.000004

(statistical error). This is most precise emission line redshift of a
GRB host galaxy reported to date. This redshift is consistent with the
host redshift reported previously (Greiner et al., GCN #2020;
Eracleous et al., GCN #2117; Caldwell et al., GCN #2053).

The emission lines are resolved in the dispersion direction with a
FWHM (H-alpha) of 1.44 +/- 0.02 Ang (56.1 km/s). While the core of the
emission lines can be fit by a Gaussian, extended wings of emission
and similar velocity substructure within the profiles are apparent. In
particular, we identify a faint emission structure that is ~66 km/s to
the red of the central core. The host plus OT continuum is discernible
in each echelle order redward of ~7000 Ang.

In ~0.4 arcsecond seeing the emission from the host plus OT is still
unresolved in the spatial direction. The compactness, the relatively
low mass implied by the velocity structure of the emission lines, and
the faintness of the host (Blake & Bloom; GCN #2011) all continue to
support the notion of the host of GRB 030329 as an intrinsically
underluminous galaxy (Eracleous et al., GCN #2117). Despite the low
overall star formation rate of the host (Caldwell et al., GCN #2053),
given the high equivalent widths of the detected lines, the
star-formation rate per unit mass may be appreciable.""

Calcium H and K absorption we infer a redshift of z=0.841+/-0.001 for the 
galaxy. This is consistent with the redshift of an absorption line in the 
spectrum of the afterglow if interpreted as MgII. This galaxy is therefore 
not the host galaxy of the GRB. In deep images obtained with the VLT/FORS2 
on May 5 the afterglow is only barely detected. We do not find any evidence 
for a host galaxy at the position of the afterglow to R>25. The separation 
between the position of the afterglow and the z=0.841 neighbor galaxy of 1.2 
arcsec is comparable to the Einstein radius for a massive galaxy at that 
redshift. Gravitational lensing could therefore affect the appearance of 
GRB 030429.

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 171205A (V. D'Elia et al. GCN #22177)
with the ESO VLT/X-shooter spectrograph, covering the wavelength range
3500-20000 AA. Spectroscopy started at 08:56:18 UT on 2017-12-05 (i.e., 1.5 hr
after the GRB) and consisted of 1 exposure of 600 s taken in twilight.

From the acquisition image prior to the spectroscopy, a new optical transient is
clearly detected in the outskirts of the putative host galaxy (L. Izzo et al.
GCN #22178) at the following coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 11h 09m 39.573s Dec.(J2000) = -12d 35' 17.37""

This source is inside the error box reported by (J.P. Osborne et al. GCN
#22179). From the acquisition image we measure this source to have m(r)~16.0
mag, calibrated with a nearby Pan-STARRS star.

The source continuum is well detected across the entire spectral coverage and
clear emission lines are superposed on it identified as Halpha, [N II] 6584, and
[S II] 6717/32 located at z = 0.0368, suggesting an association with the nearby
galaxy. Additionally, a tentative detection of absorption lines identified as
NaI 5891/5897 in the continuum further supports z = 0.0368 as the redshift of
the GRB.

report on a preliminary analysis of the Swift XRT data. Swift XRT started
observing GRB171205A (D'Elia et al. 2017, GCN 22177) 145 s after the 
trigger.
XRT detected a bright X-ray source decreasing from ~80 c/s to ~10 c/s
from 150 s to 400 s, remaining in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (Kennea et al.
2017, GCN 22183).
The hardness ratio light curve does not imply appreciable spectral
variations during this time interval.
We fit the WT spectrum binned to 20 counts per energy bin with an absorbed
power law (with the column density fixed to 5.9e20 cm-2, Willingale et al.
2013, MNRAS 431 394).
We obtain a reduced chi2=1.23 (239 degrees of freedom, dof, and 9e-3 null
hypothesis probability, nhp).
The inclusion of an intrinsic absorption component at the GRB redshift
(z=0.0368, Izzo et al. 2017, GCN 22180) does not improve the fit, rather
we can only put a 90% confidence level upper limit of N_H(z)<0.3e20 cm-2.

Given the relatively low nhp of the fit we include a soft blackbody 
component.
The fit improves considerably with kT_BB=0.10+-0.02 keV (90% c.l.) and
equivalent radius R_BB~5e11 cm (for a source distance of 163 Mpc).
The fit is good with a reduced chi2=1.09 (237 dof and 0.15 nhp).
F-test provides a probability for a chance improvement of 6e-8.
The 0.3-10 keV blackbody contribution to the total flux is ~4%.

We checked that the fit does not improve using different values for the
Galactic column density (NH_DL=4.82e20 cm-2 or NH_Kalberla=4.91e20
cm-2), reaching similar results.
Using a spectrum made from grade 0 events does not change the
results and the blackbody component is still significant.",0.0368,GRB171205A,Swift,Spectroscopic

>From an analysis of the HETE FREGATE data for GRB030519B (=H2716), we
find that the peak flux over 5 s is ~ 8 x 10^-7 erg cm-2 s-1 in the
7-30 keV energy band and ~ 7 x 10^-6 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 30-400 keV
energy band.  Similarly, we find that the fluence of the burst is 7 x
10^-6 erg cm^-2 in the 7-30 keV energy band and ~ 6 x 10^-5 erg cm-2 in
the 30-400 keV energy band.  Thus this burst is bright and its fluence
is large (the latter is in the top 1% of those for all BATSE bursts).
In addition, a preliminary spectral analysis of the FREGATE data
indicates that the spectral slope of the burst at high (> 100 keV)
energies is > -2, and thus E_peak > 400 keV.

In GCN Circular 2235 (Lamb et al. 2003), the date of the burst was
reported as 3 May 2003 and the width of the WXM localization rectangle
was reported as 24 arcminutes.  These are incorrect; the date of the

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 180620B (Evans et al. GCN 22807; Schweyer & Schady GCN 22819) using the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) UT2 equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Spectroscopic observations started on 09:27 UT on 21 June 2018, i.e. 0.73 days after burst. In the resulting spectrum, we find a series of strong absorption lines that we identify as Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, Zn II, Cr II, Al II and Al III at a common redshift of 1.1175. At this redshift, we also detect emission lines of [O II], [Ne III] and Balmer lines. Both absorption and emission lines show velocity structure. The absorption profiles are broad and spread over more than 800 km/s in velocity space.

We observed the field of GRB 180624A (Swift trigger 844192; Gibson et 
al., GCN 22832) with the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) 
instrument mounted on the 2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt Graham, AZ, USA). 
Images were obtained starting at 10:15 UT on 2018-06-25, 20.5 hr after 
the  GRB trigger.

Inspection of the 60 s acquisition image reveals a point source within 
the Swift/XRT enhanced error circle (Evans et al., GCN 22835), at 
coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 21:12:23.378
Dec(J2000)= -02:20:17.30

with an uncertainty of 0.2"" in each coordinate, which is consistent with 
the source reported by Guidorzi et al. (GCN 22839). The source has 
magnitude r' = 20.6 +- 0.1 (AB), calibrated against r'-band SDSS field 
stars, and it is not visible in Pan-STARRS images, thus clearly singling 
it out as the afterglow.

Spectroscopy of the source was obtained for a total of 2x600 s, covering 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA. A broad trough is well visible 
centered around 4700 AA, which we identify as a DLA feature at z ~ 2.86. 
Detection of several absorption features, which we interpret as due to, 
among others, Si II, C IV, Al II, Al III, Fe II, allows to precisely 
measure the redshift to be z = 2.855, which we consider to be the 
redshift of GRB 180624A.

We also note the presence of a close-by and fainter galaxy, which is 
also visible in the Pan-STARRS images, 2.5"" NW of the afterglow, at 
position:
RA(J2000) = 21:12:23.244
Dec(J2000)= -02:20:15.76
possibly consistent with the extended source reported by Schady (GCN 
22840). Given the measured redshift, we do not consider this object as 
related to the GRB, as it would have an unreasonable brightness and 
large separation at z = 2.8.

No correction for the expected Galactic foreground extinction, 
corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.05 mag in the direction of 
the burst (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011), has been applied.

X-shooter spectrograph.  One 600 s spectrum was taken during evening
twilight on 2018 July 28 beginning at 23:13 UT, plus two additional 600
s spectra on 2018 July 29 beginning at 05:10 UT.  The spectra cover a
wavelength range from 3000-25000 AA.

A red continuum is detected across the spectral range. We detect
absorption features due to Mg II (3124,3132), Mg I (3187), and Ca II
(4395,4434) at a consistent redshift of z=0.117, which we propose as the
redshift of the GRB.  Galactic ISM absorption features of Ca II and Na I
are also detected.

This GRB resembles the famous GRB 030329, but slightly less energetic
(E_iso = 2e+51 erg given the fluence value provided by Veres et al., GCN
23053).  It is the closest energetic (E_iso > 1e+51 erg) GRB with a
measured redshift to date.

We note that although Galactic extinction in this direction is
significant (A_V = 0.763; Schlafly et al. 2011, ApJ 737:103) a campaign
to study the anticipated associated supernova should still be practical
with moderate-aperture telescopes at this redshift.

We observed again the optical afterglow of the bright, low-redshift GRB 180728A (Starling et al., GCN 23046; Lipunov et al., GCB 23048; Rossi et al., GCB 23055) with the ESO VLT UT2 equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Observations were carried out around July 30.21 UT (35.5 hr after the GRB).

In our observations, the afterglow has faded significantly compared to our previous observation (Rossi et al., GCN 23055), reaching a magnitude of R ~ 20 (Vega). Continuum is detected across the whole observed range 3000-25000 AA, despite at lower S/N. Weak emission lines from a faint host are now visible, corresponding to Halpha, Hbeta, [N II], [O III] 5008 at the GRB redshift. The small Balmer decrement is consistent with negligible dust extinction in the host galaxy.

After excluding the host emission lines and correcting for Galactic extinction, the observed continuum can be fit with a single power-law with spectral index ~ 0.6 (F_nu~nu^-beta). In particular, we do not see evidence in any of our spectra for broad undulations or deviations from a power-law behavior as reported by Buckley et al. (ATel 11897).

We observed the optical counterpart (e.g. Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 23237) 
of GRB 180914B, detected by AGILE (Ursi et al., GCN 23226; Verrecchia et 
al., GCN 23231), Fermi/LAT (Bissaldi & Longo, GCN 23232), and Konus-Wind 
(Frederiks et al., GCN 23240). We used the X-shooter spectrograph on the 
ESO VLT UT2 (Kueyen), for a total exposure of 2x600 s, starting on 2018 
September 17.07 UT (2.30 days after the GRB). The covered wavelength 
range is 3000-21000 AA, and the seeing was relatively poor, around 1.5"".

 From a 15-s acquisition image, we measure the magnitude of the 
afterglow as r = 20.37 +- 0.04 (AB), calibrated against the Pan-STARRS 
catalog.

Several absorption features are detected superimposed on the afterglow 
continuum. Among them, we identify Mn II, Al III, Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, Ca 
II, all at the common redshift of z = 1.096. At the same redshift, 
fine-structure lines from Fe II are also identified, thus firmly 
establishing this value as the GRB redshift. A few emission lines from 
the underlying host are also visible. We identify the [O II] doublet and 
[O III] 5008, while other commonly observed features lie at this 
redshift in regions of poor atmospheric transparency or low S/N.

We note that our spectroscopic value is larger than the photometric 
redshift of the putative host galaxy as listed in the SDSS catalog 
(https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr14/en/tools/explore/Summary.aspx?id=1237680331629267013), 
which is however based on low-S/N photometry. At z = 1.096, the 
isotropic-equivalent energy radiated in gamma-rays is 3.6*10^54 erg, 
using the Konus-Wind fluence (1.15*10^-3 erg cm^-2; Frederiks et al., 
GCN 23240). This ranks among the highest measured values for GRBs.

spectra with increasing exposure time were collected; in this analysis we
consider only one with 600s exposure obtained in a Rapid Response Mode at
06:18:24.9 UT (at the start of observation, 0.37 hr after the GRB).

A bright continuum is observed across the entire wavelength range covered

can be identified as due to H-alpha and [OIII]5007/4959 in emission at z =

The spectrum has a very high S/N. A wide trough is easily visible around

detection of a plethora of absorption lines, including Al II, Al III, S 
II, O I, Si II, Si IV, C IV, Zn II, Cr II, Ni II, Fe II, Mn II, O I*, Si

obtained a single 600 s spectrum in the low-resolution grism 300V. 
Observations started at 00:50:50 UT on December 2 (i.e., 22.16 hr after

In the spectrum, the continuum is detected at excellent signal-to-noise 
but is largely featureless. From a non-detection of any break in the 
continuum down to 3500 , we derive a redshift upper limit of z < 1.88. 
There are no strong lines visible, but we note the possible presence of 
three weak lines, which, if real, can be identified as the Mg II doublet 
and Mg I, implying a redshift of z = 0.450. No emission lines are

The Swift-XRT Windowed Timing (WT) mode spectrum of GRB 190114C shows
an apparent strong excess of emission below ~0.8 keV when compared to
a simple absorbed powerlaw model. The excess is not thought to be
intrinsic to the GRB (e.g. an additional spectral component), but is
instead caused by a well-known instrumental effect whereby charge from
deep charge traps (formed by radiation damage to the CCD) is released
on a timescale comparable to the WT readout time (1.78ms). The
released charge is subsequently detected in trailing readout rows
as additional low energy events, causing excess emission to be seen at
low energies (see http://www.swift.ac.uk/analysis/xrt/digest_cal.php#trail).
The excess is more apparent in strongly absorbed sources such as this.

of such trailing charge from WT data. In the meantime, the WT spectra

report:

Careful spectral analysis of the prompt X-ray and gamma-ray emission 
of GRB 031026 (Butler et al; GCN 2429) confirms that this burst has a 
very hard spectrum.  This is unusual for relatively faint, long GRBs 
like GRB 030126.

We have computed a ""pseudo-redshift"" for GRB 031026, based on the 
spectral properties of its prompt high energy emission, using the 
prescription of Atteia (2003) (see A&A, 407, L1, for the definition 
of pseudo-redshift, or pseudo-z).  We determine a value of 14 for the 
pseudo-z.  This value is the highest one amongst the 40 HETE GRBs for 
which pseudo-z's have been calculated; only 3 of the 40 have 
pseudo-z's greater than 4:

GRB 020305, pseudo-z = 5.9
GRB 010612, pseudo-z = 9.5
GRB 031026, pseudo-z = 14.

For the 10 HETE GRBs with spectroscopic redshifts for which 
calculation of a pseudo-z has been possible, the pseudo-z is always 
within a factor of two of the spectroscopic redshift.  However, this 
agreement reflects to some degree the fact that the prescription used 
to calculate the pseudo-z's was optimized for these 10 bursts, and it 
has not been possible as yet to predict the pseudo-z's of an 
independent set of GRBs.  Furthermore, the 10 HETE bursts included in 
this fit span the redshift range z = 0.2 to z= 3.5, and thus no 
calibration of the pseudo-z prescription has yet been possible for a 
redshift as large as the pseudo-z value we find for GRB 031026. 
Nevertheless, we believe that it is important to report the pseudo-z 
we find for GRB 031026, given the possible importance of this burst.

Considering the unusually hard spectrum yet small peak flux of GRB 
031026, potentially revealing a source at very high redshift, we urge 
observers to perform deep observations of the HETE localization error 
circle for this burst (see GCN 2429 for more details) at other than 
optical wavelengths.  If the source of this burst truly lies at a 
very high redshift (z > 7), its optical afterglow could be 
undetectable as a result of absorption by the Lyman alpha forest, yet 
X-ray and/or IR observations might reveal a counterpart. Furthermore, 
at a fixed time of observation after the GRB, the effect of 
cosmological time dilation for a very high redshift could in 
principle increase the spectral flux in a given frequency band to 
such a degree that the afterglow would appear dramatically brighter 
than might otherwise be anticipated. Thus, a z=7 afterglow observed 
at 8 days after the burst could be as bright (e.g. in a fixed X-ray 
or IR band) as would a z=1 afterglow observed at 1 day after the 
burst (Lamb and Reichart 2000; Ciardi and Loeb 2000).

The HETE team has enhanced its prompt burst analysis software to 
perform automatic spectral analyses of Fregate burst data and then
immediately post the results to the HETE web site:
  
  http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts

This automatic spectral fit is derived from triggered data from the
Fregate instrument for bursts which are localized by the WXM and/or
the SXC.  The process takes roughly five minutes to run, and it begins 
as soon as the full burst data set is received at MIT and the WXM 
localization has been confirmed:  the results for a typical burst 
will be posted between 20 and 90 minutes after the burst, depending 
on the location of HETE in its orbit at the time of the trigger.

At present, a cutoff power law is fit to the data, and the calculated 
values of Epeak, 25-100 keV fluence, and burst duration are posted, 
along with a plot of the spectral fit generated by XSPEC (to allow
the observer the opportunity to check the automated results).  Further 
details and caveats on the method are described at

  http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts/Epeak_explanation.html

The burst web page now also includes a histogram plot of the band C
(30-400 keV) S/N ratio, which we have found to be an excellent means
of identifying true XRFs.

them vary by more than 0.1 magnitudes over the three hour time series.

If the REM source and the faint J source are in fact the same, J-K = 7
mag, whereas H-K = 1.5 mag.  If the faint J source is not the
counterpart of the REM source, then J-K > 7.  This extreme color
requires either very unusual extinction, a very unusual spectral
energy distribution, or rapid time variability of many magnitudes
sampled differently by the SMARTS and REM observations.  One
interpretation is that this source is a J-band dropout, located
at a redshift >~ 9.""

inclement weather conditions (2"".5 seeing and low transparency because 
of Calima).

The imaging consisted of 5 x 60 s exposures each in the z' and i' bands,

detected in each of the individual images. At a mean epoch 21:54:42 UT

18.33 +/- 0.04 mag as compared to field stars from the PanSTARRS

The spectrum was obtained at a mean time of 11.675 hrs after trigger and 
consisted of an exposure of 3 x 1800 s. We used the B-200 grism that 
covers the range between 3500 and 8800 AA with a resolving power of R ~

However, we are not able to match any of the marginal absorption 
features with a particular redshift. We have made the reduced spectrum 
publicly available through GRBSpec [1].

  7416.97   2852.97   1.6005   Mg I 

The mean redshift is 1.6004 +- 0.0005 (random) +- 0.0005 (systematic).
This agrees to within the quoted error with the new determination of
the absorber redshift by Hjorth et al. (GCN 249).

We note the remarkably small velocity dispersion implied by these data,
less than about 60 km/s in the restframe, suggesting that the lines arise 
from a single subgalactic-size cloud (which of course may be a part of the 
host galaxy's ISM), rather than from an ansamble of clouds moving within 
the potential well of a normal, massive galaxy.  It is also possible that 
the GRB host is a dwarf galaxy, in which case the object detected near the 
line of sight both in the K band (Djorgovski et al., GCN 243) and in the 
R band (Yadigaroglu and Halpern, GCN 248) may be a foreground galaxy.

No other convincing absorption systems, and no emission lines are detected
in these data, in the useful wavelength range of approximately 4700 to 9000
Angstroms.  We do not detect Ca II H+K absorption, nor any other common
absorption lines, e.g., Na D, nor any common emission lines (e.g., [O II] 
3727, H alpha, H beta, etc.) from either of the two absorption systems 
originally proposed by Hjorth et al. (GCN 219).

We have also measured the redshift of the galaxy approximately 10 arcsec
west of the OT.  From 4 relatively ""clean"" lines, Ca II H+K, H beta, and
H alpha, we derive for its redshift z = 0.2783 +- 0.0005.  From 4 blended
lines, CH G-band 4300, Mg I 5173+5184, Fe I + Ca I 5267, and Na D 5893,
we derive z = 0.278 +- 0.001, again in an excellent agreement with Hjorth
et al. (GCN 249).  No absorption or emission lines corresponding to this 
redshift are seen in the spectrum of the OT.

dominates the continuum at this time) will be necessary to confirm these.",0.168,GRB030329,Keck I 10-m telescope (+LRIS),Spectroscopic

equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Our spectra cover the 
wavelength range 3000-21000 AA, and consist of 4 exposures by 600 s 
each. Our observations started on 2019 August 01 at 00:48:20 UT, ~13.4 
days after the GRB detection. The slit was centred on the nucleus of the 
nearby object visible in the Pan-STARRS archival images, and was 
oriented in order to include the afterglow position.

While only weak continuum is visible, several clear emission lines are 
detected in the near-infrared arm. We identify the [O ii] 3727/3729 
doublet, Hbeta, [O iii] 4959, and [O iii] 5007, at a common redshift z = 
2.469.

No clear emission (lines nor continuum) is detected at the location of 
the afterglow, so we have no direct measurement of the GRB redshift. The 
random association probability with the Pan-STARRS object is however 
rather small (~3*10^-3), suggesting a physical connection. We also note 
that the Pan-STARRS galaxy is exceptionally luminous, with an absolute 
magnitude M = -22.9 AB (computed at 1800 AA rest frame). The measured 
offset would correspond to 6.6 kpc in projection - a rather large value 
but not surprising for such a bright host. In conclusion, we propose z =

Following the imaging sequence, we obtained a series of spectra with an

We obtained 3x1200-s of spectroscopy covering a wavelength range of ~3200-10200 Ang.

The spectrum appears very red and shows features consistent with a broad-line SN one week before maximum light. In particular, a very broad and shallow feature is present at 7800 Ang, possibly associated with O I. We find the best match to be with SN 2006aj a few days post explosion. However, a reddening correction with E(B-V) of ~0.6-0.9 mag is necessary to match the slope of the continuum of SN 2006aj at these phases. The high reddening inferred from the optical spectrum is consistent with the relatively high absorption column density reported by J.P. Osborne et al. (GCN 25568) in their X-ray analysis.

The emergence of the supernova light is consistent with the reported photometric flattening (J. Bolmer et al., GCN 25651; V. Lipunov et al., GCN 25652) and re-brightening (D. A. Perley and A. M. Cockeram; GCN 25657) of the optical source.

IAUC 7722, Filippenko & Chornock, IAUC 7737) in UGC 11794 (d=84 Mpc).
This supernova was recently shown to have a rising radio luminosity (Stockdale
et al., IAUC 8282) and bright X-ray emission (Pooley & Lewin, IAUC 8323),
both of which are atypical for a type Ic supernova at t > 2 years. An off-axis
GRB jet was proposed as an explanation for this behavior (Granot &
Ramirez-Ruiz, astro-ph/0403421).

The optical spectrum is highly unusual for a type Ic SN, and is dominated by
a broad (FWHM of 40 angstrom = 1800 km/s) H-alpha emission line. The strong
nebular features of oxygen and calcium, characteristic of old (>1 year)
SNe Ic, including SN 1998bw and SN 2002ap (e.g., Foley et al. 2003,
PASP, 115, 1220), are not detected.
The spectrum is suggestive of strong interaction with the circumstellar medium
and is similar in shape to spectra of strongly interacting type IIn
SNe at a similar age (e.g., SN 1998S, Pozzo et al. 2004, astro-ph/0404533).

This interpretation is consistent with the report by Pooley & Lewin
that the X-ray emission can be well fit with a thermal bremsstrahlung
model.  A dense circumstellar medium would also explain the bright
radio emission, as was proposed by Soderberg, Frail & Wieringa (2004,
ApJ, 607, L13).

A comparison between our spectrum of SN 2001em and those of type IIn SN 1994Y

We clearly detect continuum over the full covered wavelength range. A strong absorption is visible around 5474 AA, and an emission feature at 5479 AA, which we identify as due to H I. This is confirmed by the presence of the Ly alpha forest blueward of this wavelength. We also detect other narrower absorption features which we interpret as due to e.g. C IV and Si IV at a common redshift z = 3.503. The continuum is well detected down to ~800 AA rest frame, i.e, below the Lyman limit.

U0900_00213423  00:54:50.131  +01:12:10.33  18.90 +- 0.04

Note as the above magnitudes are fainter than those given by USNO, 
by about 0.4  mag. This may indicate a non photometric night, or 
that the USNO catalog is not particularly accurate in this region 
of the sky.

Starting on Oct 7.10 UT, a low resolution (R ~ 1000) spectrum of the 
transient was also obtained. Observations consisted of three exposures, 
for a total exposure time of 1 hour, and cover the full spectral range 
3800-8000 A. The observed spectrum has a relatively low signal-to-noise 
and does not show any strong obvious emission line. The most prominent 
absorption feature is at 4800 A. If this feature is identified with the 
blend of the MgII lambda2803,2796 doublet, a redshift of z=0.712 is 
implied. If this is the case, the MgI lambda2852, FeII lambda2382,2374 
and FeII lambda2344 transitions might coincide with other absorption 
features in the spectrum, although each single line is not statistically
significant. 

At the estimated  redshift the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy of 
the burst is E = 1.5x10^52 erg (2-400 keV), adopting the fluence reported 
by Galassi et al. (GCN 2770),

All of these lines are consistent with a redshift z = 0.859.

The presence of [NeIII] implies a galaxy with a significant 
population of massive stars. The isotropic energy of the burst is 
E_iso=1.48x10^52 erg, using the 25-100 keV fluence value from HETE 
and a cosmology with H_0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_matter=0.3 and

energy is likely to be much lower.
The presence of continuum features relating to a supernova
can only be determined after further analysis: a SN1998bw-like bump

A trace is visible across the full spectral range. In the blue part, 
weak absorption features are detected which can be interpreted as Mg II, 
Mg I and Ca II at z = 0.423. Faint emission lines are also detected at a 
consistent redshift, identified as [O II] and Halpha. Our data allow 
thus to confirm the redshift value reported by de Ugarte Postigo et al. 
(GCN 28649) using the GTC. We note that the detection of absorption 
features sets a firm lower limit to the GRB redshift, excluding a chance 
superposition with a background galaxy.

S. G. Djorgovski, S. R. Kulkarni, J. S. Bloom (Caltech), and D. A. Frail
(NRAO) report on behalf of the Caltech-CARA-NRAO GRB Collaboration:

Spectra of the host galaxy of GRB 970228 were obtained in the course of
several runs at the Keck-II 10-m telescope.  A prominent emission line at 
6319 A was observed in at least 3 independent data sets, along with a very 
blue continuum, showing no apparent breaks between about 4000 and 8900 A.  
We interpret this emission line as [O II] 3727 at z = 0.695 +- 0.002.
Moreover, possible emission lines are detected corresponding to [Ne III] 
3869 and [O III] 5007 at the same redshift.  We thus consider this redshift
to be practically secure.

Assuming a cosmology with H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_0 = 0.2, and Lambda_0 = 0, 
we derive the luminosity distance of 1.28 e28 cm.  The measured fluence from
Ulysses (cf. Hurley et al. 1997, ApJ, 485, L1) of 4.3 e-6 erg/cm2 then implies 
E(gamma,isotropic) = 5.2 e51 erg.

We detect continuum flux in the V band of about 0.12 uJy, uncertain by at 
least 20%.  This is in an excellent agreement with the published ground-based 
and HST photometry, corresponding to V ~ 26 mag.

The [O II] line has the equivalent width 75 +- 15 A (observed), or 44 +- 9 A 
(restframe), typical for star-forming galaxies at comparable redshifts.  The
very blue continuum suggests little restframe extinction in this galaxy.

In the following estimates, we assume a Galactic extinction correction A(V) = 
0.75 mag.  From the [O II] line flux, we estimate SFR = 0.47 Msun/yr, and from
the continuum power at 2800 A (rest), SFR = 0.35 Msun/yr.  Both of these are 
uncertain by at least 30%.  The absolute restframe B band luminosity of the 
galaxy corresponds to about 0.05 to 0.1 L_* today.  Thus, neither the SFR 
nor the SFR per unit mass are especially high.

""On December 28, 1997, Kundic and Lubin obtained spectra of the optical
transient of GRB 971214 (IAUC 6788) with the Low Resolution Imaging
Spectrograph (LRIS) mounted on the Keck II telescope.  The seeing
conditions were excellent.  If the transient continued the power-law
decay as indicated by the data from Halpern et al. IAUC 6788) then by
this epoch the light at this position should be dominated by the host
(cf. Kulkarni et al. GCN #27; ATEL #5).  Analysis of these spectra show
a slightly extended emission feature at 5384 A.  Additionally, a broad
absorption feature is seen at 5752 A.  We cannot at this time make a
definitive statement about the redshift of the host.  If, the emission
feature is identified as Lyman-alpha and the absorption feature as OI
1302 A then the redshift of the (presumed) host is z=3.43. However,
there appears to be no obvious depression bluewards of this feature as
is normally seen in high-redshift objects (caused by the Lyman
forest).  If, however,  the emission feature is identified with the
[OII] 3727 line then the redshift is z=0.44.

A strong emission feature at a wavelength of 5602 A is also seen in the
spectrum of the nearby galaxy G1 (GCN #12; GCN #13).  Identifying this as
the [OII] 3727 A feature as well as matching major absorption features
yields a redshift of z=0.50.

We are in the process of analyzing additional LRIS data to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio and also to understand the apparent discrepancy
with similar data obtained on 17 Dec 1997 UT (GCN #12).  We note that
the earlier data were obtained under bright lunar conditions while the
data reported herein was obtained during dark time.

started at 01:30 UT on 2020-12-17, 2.38 hr after the burst, and 
consisted of 4 exposures of 600 s each.

The afterglow is well-detected in the stacked spectrum, but the 
continuum is very red. As a consequence, the S/N drops dramatically from 
the red to the blue end. We identify a doublet which we tentatively 
match to Ca II H & K at z = 1.10. Unfortunately, no other lines are 
detected to confirm this value, though most of them would fall in a 
spectral region of poor S/N. We note that Ca II H&K absorption is 
uncommon in intervening absorbers, making it likely this is the actual 
redshift of the GRB, and that it does not lie at an even greater 
distance (in accordance with the VHE detection).

A redshift of z = 1.1 would place this object among the most distant 
known VHE sources. Using the Fermi GBM parameters (Malacaria et al., GCN 
#29073), we derive a an observer-frame 10-1000 keV isotropic energy 
release of E_iso = (4.71 +/- 0.16) * 10^53 erg.

Based on our grz photometry (Izzo et al., GCN 29066), we measure a 
spectral slope beta_opt = 4.1 +- 0.2 (Fnu propto nu^-beta), which is an 
unusually red value, suggesting significant extinction. This is 
confirmed by the optical-to-X-ray spectral index, beta_OX ~ 0.1 which 
indicates a very low optical/X-ray flux ratio, making this a bona fide 
dark GRB.

We observed the field of GRB 201221A (Page et al., GCN 29096) using the 
ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph.

Using the acquisition camera, multi-band imaging was secured. Within the 
XRT error circle (Evans, GCN 29097), no source is detected in an r-band 
image (taken at mean epoch of 42 min after the GRB) down to limiting 
magnitude r > 23.5 (AB). However, a source is clearly visible in the 
z-band image with z = 19.76 +- 0.04 AB (mean time 35 min after the GRB). 
The corresponding color r-z > 3.7 is exceptionally red. The coordinates 
of the object are (J2000, 0.3"" error):

RA = 14:17:55.26
Dec = -45:24:58.0

Spectroscopy of the z-band source was executed covering the wavelength 
range 3000-25000 AA. Unfortunately due to visibility constraints, only 
two spectra by 600 s each were secured, plus two extra exposures during 
twilight which have lower quality. We report on the analysis of the 
first set only, which has a mean time of 1.65 hr after the GRB.

Continuum is well detected in the infrared arm, as well as in the red 
part of the visible arm. A clear break is detected around 8150 AA, 
which, if interpreted as the Lyman break, corresponds to z = 5.70. Weak 
continuum is detected blueward of the break, until it vanishes 
completely at the corresponding location of the Lyman limit. We thus 
conclude that z = 5.70 is the redshift of GRB 201221A.

The spectrum shows a weak continuum over the full spectral range. There 
is a prominent emission feature that we identify as the [OII] 3727/3729 
doublet at a redshift of 1.046. This line happens to lie in the 
atmospheric A band, and therefore must be quite strong to be detectable. 
There are also low significance absorption featuress coincident with 
FeII and MgII at a similar redshift (z = 1.045). We identify this as the 
redshift of GRB 201221D. We note this is a high redshift for a short 
GRB, and it represents one of the few short GRB spectra to show 
afterglow absorption features.",1.046,GRB 201221D,"OSIRIS at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Spain)",Spectroscopic

was detected by Konus-Wind (KW) in the waiting mode.

A Bayesian block analysis of the KW waiting mode data in the 20-400 keV band
reveals a ~11 sigma count rate increase over background in the interval
from ~T0(BAT)-10 s to ~T0(BAT)+20 s.
The KW light curve of this burst is available
at http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB201221A/

To derive the broad-band spectral parameters of this burst, we performed
a joint spectral analysis of the Swift/BAT data (15-150 keV) and the Konus-Wind
3-channel spectral data, which cover the energy range from ~20 keV to ~1.5 MeV.

The time-averaged spectrum, measured from T0(BAT)-9.6 s to T0(BAT)+19.8 s,
is best fit in the 15 keV - 1.5 MeV range by the GRB (Band)
function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.95 (-0.22,+0.31),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.39 (-0.89,+0.38),
and the peak energy Ep = 194 (-63,+81) keV, chi2 = 65/58 dof.

In the 15-1500 keV band, the total burst fluence S is 4.3(-0.4, + 0.7)x10^-6 erg/cm^2,
and the 2.944 s peak energy flux Fp is 2.0 (-0.2, + 0.3)x10^-7 erg/cm^2.
In the 10-10000 keV band, standard for the KW analysis, S = 5.3(-1.0, + 2.3)x10^-6 erg/cm^2
and Fp = 2.4 (-0.4, + 1.0)x10^-7 erg/cm^2.

Assuming the redshift z=5.70 (Malesani et al., GCN 29100)
and a standard cosmology with H_0 = 67.3 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.315,
and Omega_Lambda = 0.685 (Planck Collaboration, 2014),
we estimate the isotropic energy release E_iso to 3.0(-0.5,+1.3)x10^53 erg,
the isotropic luminosity L_iso to 9.0(-1.6,+3.9)x10^52 erg/s,
and the rest-frame peak energy of the time-integrated spectrum Ep,z to 1300(-420,+540) keV.

Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) instrument mounted on the 
2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt Graham, AZ, USA). Data were obtained at the 
mid time of 04:00 UT on 2020-11-13, ~28.8 days after the burst trigger.

Spectroscopy of the source was obtained for a total of 8x900 s, covering 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA. All the spectra have been corrected 
for the Galactic extinction (A_V = 0.93). The low S/N spectrum shows a 
peak around 5400 AA (rest frame) and is consistent with type Ic-BL 
supernova spectra around maximum light, in agreement with the results 
presented by Pozanenko et al. (GCN 29033).

Together with the spectroscopy we also obtained g and r-band imaging of 
the supernova, which thanks to the good seeing of 0.6"" it is separated 
enough from the host galaxy to avoid contamination. We find r=23.5+-0.1 
for the SN and r=22.9+-0.2 for the host galaxy, calibrated against 
Pan-STARRS field stars.

equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Spectroscopic observations
started at 01:38 UT on 06 February 2021, i.e. ~1.8 days after the burst
detection and they consisted of 4 x 600 s exposures. In the resulting
spectrum, we find a series of strong absorption lines that we identify as
Mg II, Si IV, C IV, and Ca II at a common redshift of 1.466. At this
redshift, we also detect emission lines of [O II], [O III] and H-alpha
Balmer line. We therefore conclude that z = 1.466 is the redshift of
ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv.

The measured redshift implies a high intrinsic brightness (absolute
magnitude ~ 28 at an epoch of 45 min after the GRB; Kool et al., GCN
29405), which is typical of long GRB afterglows. This, coupled with the
observed absorption lines set, typical of long GRB environments, further
strengthens the association between ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv and GRB 210204A.

Off-line reanalysis of our data of GRB 210204A (ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv; 
Kool et al., GCN 29405) made us realise that we had used an incorrect 
data set for our previous GCN circular (Izzo et al., GCN 29411). We 
report here the correct analysis and results, and urge users to 
disregard GCN 29411. We regret for any confusion created by this mishap.

Our data of GRB 210204A were acquired with the X-shooter spectrograph 
installed on the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) telescope. Four spectra by 600 s 
each were secured, starting on 2021 Feb 6.08 UT (1.79 days after the 
trigger) and covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA.

Continuum is clearly detected across the entire trace. A number of 
absorption features are detected; we identify, among others, Al II, Zn 
II, Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, Ca II H and K at a common redshift z = 0.876. In 
particular, fine-structure lines from Fe II* are also visible, which 
confirms the association of this absorption system with the GRB. 
Emission lines due to [O II], [O III], H beta and H alpha are also 
detected at z = 0.876.

We thus conclude that ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv is at redshift z = 0.876.

Three intervening Mg II absorbers are also detected, at redshift 0.71, 
0.66, and 0.57.

The revision of the redshift value does not affect our previous 
conclusion that ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv is the likely afterglow of GRB 
210204A (Fermi GBM Team, GCN 29390; Li et al., GCN 29392; Hurley et al., 
GCN 29408; Waratkar et al., GCN 29410): at z = 0.876, the transient 
reached an absolute magnitude of ~ -26.7 (Kool et al., GCN 29405), 
within the range of long GRB afterglows. The set of absorption features 
(including those due to fine-structure transitons) is also typical of 
GRB environments.

We recompute the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy using the fluence 
reported by Konus-Wind (Frederiks, GCN 29424) and the correct redshift 
value, which turns to be ~8.7*10^52 erg.

A Bayesian block analysis of the KW waiting mode data in the 20-400 keV band

from ~T0(BAT)-1.7 s to ~T0(BAT)+7.1 s.
The KW light curve of this burst is available
at http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB210210A/

To derive the broad-band spectral parameters of this burst, we performed
a joint spectral analysis of the Swift/BAT data (15-150 keV) and the Konus-Wind
3-channel spectral data, which cover the energy range from ~20 keV to ~1.5 MeV.

The time-averaged spectrum, measured from T0(BAT)-1.685 s to T0(BAT)+7.147 s,
is best fit in the 15 keV - 1.5 MeV range by a power law with an exponential cutoff.
This fit gives a photon index alpha -1.68 (-0.23,+0.25), and Ep of 16.6 (-10.7,+7.2) keV
(chi^2 = 47.5/ 58 dof).
A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index of (2.52  0.07), chi^2 = 58.4/ 59 dof.
The joint fit results are consistent with the Swift-BAT refined analysis (GCN 29467).

In the 15-1500 keV band, the total burst fluence, estimated from the CPL model,
is (1.2  0.1)x10^-6 erg/cm^2, and the 2.944 s peak energy flux is (2.4  0.2)x10^-7 erg/cm^2.

Observations of the optical counterpart of GRB 210306A using the B&C
Spectrograph and the University of Arizona, Steward Observatory 2.3m Bok
Telescope located on Kitt Peak, Arizona began at 07:07:50 on March 6, 2021
UTC and ended at 08:23:13 UT.  Three, 1500 s exposures were obtained
centered at 3.384, 3.859, and 4.279 hours after the Swift/BAT detection of
the burst (DElia et al.; GCN Circ. 29597).  Comparison with a
spectrophotometric standard star observed immediately after the optical
afterglow observations suggest that the counterpart was at an approximate
V magnitude of 19.18, 19.33, and 19.46 for the three exposures,
respectively. All spectra show a featureless blue continuum from 350-760nm.
A fit to the least noisy portion (450-750nm) of the scaled median spectrum
from the three observations yields a slope of about -1.25 in log(F_lambda)
vs. log(wavelength). No corrections for Galactic extinction and reddening
have been made.",No Redshift,GRB 210306A,"Steward Observatory, University of Arizona",Spectroscopic

We observed the afterglow (Jelinek et al., GCN #29651; Lipunov et al., 
GCN #29652) of INTEGRAL GRB 210312B (Mereghetti et al., GCN #29650) with 
OSIRIS at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (Roque de los Muchachos 
Observatory, La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain), starting at 2021-03-12 
22:57:10.834 UT under adverse conditions (2"" seeing, bad transparency 
because of Calima). Following the finding chart exposure (Kann et al., 
GCN #29653), we obtained 2 x 900 s spectroscopic exposures with the 
R1000B grism, covering the spectral range from 3700 to 7800 AA, before 
the telescope was shut down due to worsening observing conditions. We 
detect a faint trace in both images. We resumed observations after an 
improvement in weather conditions at 2021-03-13 01:41:40.281 UT, 
obtaining two further finding charts and 4 x 900 s spectra with the same 
grism.

Using the same comparison star as Kann et al., GCN #29653, we find the 
afterglow has faded to r' = 22.36 +/- 0.03 mag (AB) at 4.8316 hrs after 
the GRB trigger.

Combining the first spectral exposure and the latter, for a total 
exposure of 5 x 900 s, a trace is clearly detected redwards of 4300 AA, 
as well as several absorption lines. We identify these as FeII, MgII, 
and MgI, at a mean redshift of z = 1.069. At this redshift, we also 
detect OII in emission, which allows us to identify this as the redshift 
of the GRB.",z = 1.069,INTEGRAL GRB 210312B,Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC),Spectroscopic

We observed ZTF20abbiixp/AT2020kym (Ho et al., GCN #27799), the afterglow of the long-duration GRB 200524A (Pookalil et al., GCN #27809; Fana Dirirsa et al., GCN #27797; Gupta et al., GCN #27818; Svinkin et al., GCN #27867), with GMOS-N under our ToO program GN-2020A-Q-117 (PI: Miller). The observation, conducted in the Nod-and-Shuffle mode with a 1 arcsec slit, started at 2020-05-25 07:39:14.9 UT, corresponding to 26.6 hours after the Fermi-GBM trigger (Pookalil et al., GCN #27809). A power-law fit to the afterglow light curve (Ho et al., GCN #27799; Kumar et al., GCN #27800, #27804; Perley & Ho, GCN #27805) suggests that ZTF20abbiixp was at r=21.5 and g=21.8 at the time of Gemini observation.

We obtained 3 x 550 s spectroscopic exposures with the B600 grating and 3 x 550 s exposures with the R400 grating, providing coverage over the range 3620-9600 AA. No flux calibration was performed. The spectrum was reduced using the IRAF package for GMOS. A trace was detected redwards of 4900 AA. Bluewards of 4900 AA, the source was not significantly detected, probably because of the faintness of the object, the intrinsic red color of the afterglow (g-r ~ 0.3 mag) and low sensitivity at the blue end.

We clearly identified absorption lines of Mg II 2796 and Mg II 2803 at the redshift of z = 1.256 in the three individual exposures. Absorption from Mg I 2852 is marginally detected in the combined spectrum at consistent redshift. We therefore identify z=1.256 as the most probable redshift for the GRB, although in practice this is only a lower limit.

Following the imaging sequence, we obtained spectroscopy of the afterglow with ALFOSC using grism 4 (320 to 960 nm) and for 4x1200 sec total integration. A faint trace is detected but we do not identify any particular absorption or emission features to infer the redshift from.

shows very weak lines consistent with several features of FeII, MgII

This is a followup report on Swift/BAT GRB050124 (GCN Circ. 2972, Markwardt
et al.) The ground-calculated BAT location is RA, Dec 192.884, 13.024 degrees 
(J2000). At 43 degrees from the BAT boresight, we expect the uncertainty 
to be primarily systematic due to currently uncalibrated image distortion 
(Swift/BAT image calibration activities are still in progress). The 
systematic uncertainty is approximately 3 arcmin (radius). 

Further analysis yields a fluence of (2.1 +- 0.2) x 10^-6 ergs/cm2 and a
1-second peak flux of (6.8 +- 0.4) ph/cm2/s in the 15-350 keV band. The  
power-law photon index is 1.48 in the 20 - 150 keV band.

T90 is 4.1 seconds and T50 is 2.1 seconds. The burst had 2 peaks, the first
2 seconds long with a rise in 0.1 seconds from a baseline that was slightly 
elevated for about 1.4 seconds, and the second about 1 second long. There is
a low-significance (3.6 sigma image) hint of a 1-second precursor at -16

Dec = -39:06:08.3

We measure for this target an AB magnitude r = 22.3 +- 0.1 (calibrated 
against the Legacy Survey, but only very few, faint stars are present in 
the acquisition camera field of view). We note that at the same 
position, to within the uncertainties, there is a faint object visible 
in the Legacy Survey, with AB magnitude r ~ 23.7. We conclude that the 
above source is the optical afterglow of GRB 210517A, and the archival 
object is its host galaxy.

In our spectra, continuum is detected over the whole observed range. A 
prominent emission line is detected around 4236 AA, which we identify as 
Ly alpha in emission. This interpretation is confirmed by the detection 
of both emission lines in the near-infrared arm (corresponding to [O II]

Si II, Si IV, O I, C IV, C II, all at a common redshift z = 2.486. 
Consistent with the detection of bright Ly alpha in emission, the

The T_50 durations for GRB 050209 are approximately 16, 17, and 15 s in
the 6-40, 6-80 and 30-400 keV energy bands, respectively; the T_90 
durations for the burst are approximately 36, 41, and 46 s in the same
energy bands.

The spectrum of GRB 050209 evolves strongly from hard to soft during
the burst.  Ground analysis of the FREGATE and WXM spectral data show
that the average spectrum of the burst is adequately fit by a single
power-law with index alpha = - 1.7  0.07 in the 2-400 keV energy band,
implying that E_0 lies near or above 400 keV and E_peak lies above 120
keV.  The fluences in the 2-30 keV and 30-400 keV energy bands are 1 x
10-6 and 2 x 10-6 erg cm-2, respectively; the fluence in the 2-400 keV
energy band is therefore 3 x 10-6 erg cm-2.  The fluence ratio 
S(2-30 keV)/S(30-400 kev) = 0.33.  Technically, this makes GRB 050209 
an ""X-ray rich"" burst, despite the relatively high value of E_peak.  
This is due to the steepness of the low-energy power-law index alpha. 
Because we are only able to place a lower bound on E_peak, we can only
place a lower limit on the pseudo-redshift for this burst of about 2.

We observed the afterglow of GRB 210610B (Page et al., GCN 30170; Kumar et al., GCN 30174; Rumyantsev et al., GCN 30175; Hu et al., GCN 30177; de Wet et al., GCN 30180; Romanov, GCN 30181; Fynbo et al GCN 30182; Moskvitin et al.

Observation consisted of 3 x 900 s exposures with grism R1000B, covering the range between 3700 and 7800 AA. The first spectrum started at 01:36:20 UT (5.75 hr after the burst).

The spectrum shows a very strong continuum with very weak superposed lines. We detect lines corresponding to FeII, MgII and MgI at a common redshift of z = 1.1345, in agreement with the measurement from the NOT (Fynbo et al. GCN 30182). Additionally, the high SNR allows us to detect a weak intervening system through the identification of MgII at a redshift of z = 0.557. Although the redshift 1.1345 is, strictly speaking, a lower limit, the lack of any further features at higher redshift, especially considering the high SNR of the spectrum, allows us to consider this as the redshift of the GRB.

We note that the features detected at the redshift of the GRB are very weak. We can compare their strength to a sample of long GRB afterglow features using the line strength parameter, following the method of de Ugarte Postigo et al. (2012, A&A 548, A11). For this spectrum we measure LSP = -2.1 +/- 0.8, which implies that the lines are weaker than 99.8% of the sample.",1.1345,GRB 210610B,GTC,Spectroscopic

The observation started at 2:27 UT (2.45 hr after the burst) and consisted of 3x600 s with grism R1000B, covering the spectral range between 3700 and 7800 AA.

In a preliminary reduction with old calibrations we detect a strong continuum with a plethora of absorption features superposed to it. We identify features that include SiII, SiIV, OI, CI, CII, CIV, FeII, AlII, AlIII, NiII, CrII ZnII, as well as fine structure lines of SiII, FeII, NiII at a common redshift of 1.937, which we identify as the redshift of the GRB. We also detect an intervening system with MgII and MgI at z=1.095.

Additionally, the flux calibrated spectrum shows a strong broad absorption feature at ~4500AA, resembling a dust bump. This could be consistent with a 2175 AA dust feature due to the intervening absorber.

We note that at a redshift of 1.937, the initial prompt emission spike is extremely luminous, and we expect the afterglow to be among the most luminous prompt flashes ever detected. Using the fluence reported on the automatic Swift/BAT analysis page in the 15-350 keV band, we derive an E_iso ~ 1.7e54 erg, without any k-correction.  This implies GRB 210619B will likely be among the most energetic GRBs ever detected once a k-correction to the bolometric band is applied.

Further analysis is ongoing. We encourage further observations.",1.937,GRB 210619B,GTC,Spectroscopic

GRB 210702A (Lien et al., GCN #30351) using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) 
equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Our spectra cover the 
wavelength range 3000-25000 AA, and consist of 4 exposures of 600 s 
each. The observation mid-time was 2021 July 2.997 UT (i.e., 4.80 hr

In a 20 s image taken with the acquisition camera on July 02.975 UT, we 
detect the optical afterglow at r' = 16.91 +/- 0.01 mag (AB system), 
measured against three SkyMapper field stars.

In our spectrum, strong continuum is detected over the whole observed 
range. We detect a plethora of metallic absorption features, among them 
Si II, Si II*, C IV, Fe II, Fe II*, Al II, Ni II, Ni II*, Al III, Zn II, 
Mg I, Cr II, Mn II, Mg II, Mg I, and Ca II, all at a common redshift of 
z = 1.160. This is about 1.5 sigma lower than, but is broadly consistent 
with the value reported by Swift/UVOT (Kuin et al., GCN #30355). No

the Roque de los Muchachos observatory (La Palma, Spain). The 
observation consisted of 2x60s acquisition images in r-band followed by 
4x600s spectra with grism R1000B, covering the spectral range between 
3700 and 7800 AA. The observation started at 21:48:57 UT (26.26 hr after 
the burst) and the combined spectrum has an average epoch of 22:18:25 
UT (26.75 hr after the burst).

The afterglow is well detected in the acquisition image at an r-band 
magnitude of 22.40 +/- 0.07 as compared to several SDSS field stars. The 
spectrum shows continuum above 3800 AA with a typical SNR of 5 above 
5000 AA. 

The detection of continuum down to 3800 AA implies an upper limit on the 
redshift of z < 3.15.

We do not detect any absorption or emission features at the redshift of the 
field galaxy (z = 0.0817) or field cluster (z = 0.203) reported in by Levan et 
al. in GCN #30381. However, a featureless spectrum would be expected 
if this event were a short GRB in an intracluster environment.

We note that there is a tentative detection of a broad dip in the continuum at 
~ 4050 AA, that could be identified as due to Ly-alpha. However, we caution 
that the SNR in this part of the spectrum is very low. This would imply a 
redshift of z = 2.34, and could be sustained by further low-significance 
detections of OI, SiII and CII. However, we also note that at this redshift 
there is no detection of CIV, nor SiIV, which is uncommon but not 
unprecedented.

etal., GCN 30380; Ridnaia et al., GCN 30388) using publicly available 
data of GBM/Fermi. The burst consists of several episodes of emission 
with duration of T_90 = 4.6 s, but the emission is visible up to 20 s 
after the trigger. Energy spectrum constructed in the time interval of 
(-0.2, 6.5) seconds relative to the GBM trigger time is best described 
by Bandmodel with relatively low E_peak = 294 keV corroborating with 
E_peak reported by GBM team (Malacaria et al., GCN 30380) and Konus-Wind 
(Ridnaia et al., GCN 30388).

Based on E_peak, Fluence in 1 keV  10 MeV range (2.77e-5 erg cm^-2) and 
T_90 we draw a trajectory of the burst in EH - T_90 diagram varying the 
unknown source redshift 
(http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB210704A/GRB210704A_EH-T90_GBM.png , see [1-2] for 
details). The lower 2 sigma redshift limit of the source is z=0.11, 
which excludes the association of the GRB with the field galaxy at z = 
0.0817, but leaves a possibility of association with the field cluster 
at z = 0.203 (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 30392). We also estimate 
E_iso = 8.2e50 erg at z = 0.11 and E_iso = 3.7e53 erg at z = 2.34 
(marginally suggested after GTC spectroscopy, de Ugarte Postigo et al., 
GCN 30392).
Based only on the trajectory at the EH - T_90 diagram we could suggest 
the collapsar origin (Type II) of GRB 210704A.

Spectroscopy of the source reveals a continuum well detected in the red

We observed the field surrounding the candidate afterglow (source #2) of 
the short GRB 211106A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 31049; D'Elia et al., GCNs 
31051, 31068) with the ESO VLT equipped with the MUSE panoramic 
integral-field spectrograph, covering a square 1'x1' region around the 
XRT position. Spectra of each spaxel cover the wavelength range 
4750-9350 AA. The mean time of our observation was November 10.03 UT 
(3.84 days after the GRB).

We report the redshift of three galaxies close to the XRT error circle 
(D'Elia et al., GCN 31068; see also Malesani et al., GCN 31070):

#1)
RA = 22:54:20.29
Dec = -53:13:53.6
z = 0.097 as inferred by the detection of the [O iii] doublet and Hbeta 
in emission.
The projected separation from the center of the XRT error circle is 
4.8"", or 8.6 kpc at z = 0.097.

A bright, pointlike object (RA = 22:54:20.32, Dec = -53:13:56.7) is 
spatially blended with this galaxy, which we confirm to be a star thanks 
to the detection of Balmer and Ca II absorption at z = 0.

#2)
RA = 22:54:21.31
Dec = -53:13:47.2
z = 0.294 as inferred by the detection of the [O iii] doublet and Hbeta 
in emission.
The projected separation from the center of the XRT error circle is 
7.9"", or 34.9 kpc at z = 0.294.

#3)
RA = 22:54:20.34
Dec = -53:13:40.8
z = 1.012 as inferred by the detection of the (resolved) [O ii] doublet 
in emission.
The projected separation from the center of the XRT error circle is 
8.3"", or 67.0 kpc at z = 1.012.


While the association of these sources with GRB 211106A cannot be 
confirmed based on our data, object #1 has the smallest chance 
association probability. With R ~ 21.5, using the formula by Bloom et 
al. (2002, AJ, 123, 1111), we compute a chance association probability 
of ~5%.


Stacking the MUSE cube along the wavelength axis, faint emission is also 
detected inside the XRT error circle, consistent with our FORS2 image 
(Malesani et al., GCN 31070). The S/N is too low to extract any spectral 
information, and no emission lines are identified.

We report the results of the photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of 
the short GRB 211023B (Dichiara et al., GCN Circ. 30960) obtained with 
the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) instrument mounted on the 
2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt Graham, AZ, USA). Data were obtained at the 
mid time of 12:40 UT on 2021-11-06, ~13.6 days after the burst trigger.

At the position of the UVOT localization (Kuin & Dichiara, GCN 30975) 
and the Legacy Survey object (Pozanenko et al., GCN 30972), we detect 
the GRB host galaxy (Sakamato et al. GCN 31038, Rastinejad et al. GCN 
31002). We measure the following AB magnitudes:
g = 24.02+-0.17
r = 23.99+-0.15
calibrated against Pan-STARRS field stars and not corrected for Galactic 
extinction.

Spectroscopy of the source was obtained for a total of 4550s, covering 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA.Continuum is faintly detected over 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA, and a single emission line is 
visible at ~6940 AA. The most likely interpretation is [O II] at z = 
0.862. At this redshift, [O III] would unfortunately fall on top of a 
region affected by sky lines, so its non-detection is not very 
constraining. Other interpretations are less likely. We can disregard 
Lyalpha, since there is no drop in the continuum blueward of the line. 
We deem Halpha unlikely, as the corresponding redshift z = 0.057 would 
imply an extremely faint host galaxy (absolute magnitude ~ -13), and we 
don't see the expected [O III] and Hbeta lines. The interpretation of 
the observed feature as [O III] 5008 seems to be also unlikely as we 
would expect to detect hints of [O III] 4959 as well as Halpha which 
would fall in a wavelength region clean of skylines.

Assuming the redshift z=0.862, standard cosmology (Planck 2016) and 
Swift/BAT refined and on-line automated spectral analysis (Laha et al., 
GCN 30979, and http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1080859/BA/ 
<http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1080859/BA/>) we estimate an 
isotropic-equivalent radiated energy Eiso (1-10000 keV) of about 
(0.9-1.2)x E^51 erg, which is typical of short GRBs. However, we note that:
a) despite its short duration, the burst has a rather soft spectrum 
(simple power with index ~2) which is consistent with a spectral peak 
energy Ep close to (or even below) the BAT low-energy threshold and 
would imply a rest-frame peak energy Ep,i < ~30-40 keV, thus locating 
this GRB in the region of the Ep,i - Eiso plane populated by long GRBs. 
The preliminary automatic modelling with a cut-off power-law or a Band 
function is consistent with a larger Ep,i, which would make this burst 
more similar to other short GRBs, but with a very large uncertainty.
b) the soft spectra and short duration put GRB 211023B closer to the 
region populated by long GRBs than to to the one populated by short 
events also in the HR-T90 diagram, even though it is still consistent 
with belonging to the tail of the distribution of short GRBs in this plane.

In a 60 s image taken with the acquisition camera on Dec 8.249 UT, we detect the optical afterglow, for which we measure an AB magnitude r = 22.16 +/- 0.05 mag (calibrated against two nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog).

We clearly detect continuum over the wavelength range 3400 - 18000 AA. A trough is visible around 3960 AA, which we identify as due to H I. From detection of multiple absorption features, which we interpret as due to Si II, O I, C II, Fe II, Si IV, C IV, Al II, Mg II, we infer a redshift z = 2.272.

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 211211A (D'Ai et al., GCN 
31202; Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 31203) using the Nordic Optical Telescope 
(NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC instrument. Images were secured in the 
SDSS r, g and i filters.

At the mean time of Dec 12.24 UT (16.6 hr after the GRB), we measure a 
magnitude r = 20.89 +- 0.05 AB, calibrated against nearby stars from the 
Pan-STARRS survey. Our measurement is in agreement with those by 
Strausbaugh & Cucchiara (GCN 31214) and de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN 
31218), taken at a comparable epoch. Compared to the magnitudes reported 
by Zheng & Filippenko (GCN 31203), Ito et al. (GCN 31217) and Jang (GCN 
31213), our data confirm the unusually slow decay,

We report for the afterglow the following coordinates (0.3"" uncertainty):

RA = 14:09:10.12
Dec = +27:53:18.1

A bright, extended object (r ~ 19.5) is visible about 5.5"" to the N-E of 
the afterglow (as already pointed out by Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 31203), 
which is also visible in the SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and Legacy surveys.

A spectrum was secured covering both the afterglow and the nearby galaxy 
(wavelength range 3700-9400 AA). A weak emission line is detected on top 
of the host galaxy trace at 7063 AA, which could be due to Halpha at z = 
0.076. This is marginally consistent with the SDSS photometric redshift 
0.140 +- 0.0375, unlike other interpretations of the same line.

No clear absorption or emission features are detected in the afterglow 
trace. This may be due to the modest S/N, and is also consistent with a 
low redshift, as is the detection of the afterglow in all the UVOT UV 
filters (Swift observation ID 1088940000).

It is not clear at the present stage whether the afterglow is physically 
associated with the galaxy at z = 0.076. While the sky proximity and the 
low redshift are indeed suggestive, the physical offset at z = 0.076 
would be about 8 kpc (in projection), an unusually large value for long 
GRBs. There is also no visible emission in the archival images down to r 
~ 24 (AB) at the location of the afterglow, which would be unusual for a 
long GRB at z = 0.076.

Moreover, if placed at z = 0.076, GRB 211211A would be an outlier of the 
the Amati relation (e.g. Nava et al. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 1256), with E_iso 
= 1.4*10^54 erg and E_peak ~ 700 keV (using the Fermi/GBM prompt 
properties from Mangan et al., GCN 31210).

Overall, a moderate-redshift GRB (with z > 0.076) is consistent with the 
available information. The detection of an emerging supernova could 
clarify the situation. We encourage further photometric and 
spectroscopic follow-up of this potentially interesting event.",0.076,GRB 211211A,Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT),Spectroscopic

We analyzed GRB 211211A (D'Ai et al. GCN 31202; Mangan et al. GCN 31210; 
Tamura et al. GCN 31226) using publicly available data of GBM/Fermi and 
SPI-ACS/INTEGRAL. Using GBM/Fermi we estimate a duration in 7 - 850 keV 
energy band T_90 = 50.6 +/- 0.1 s, while the emission is seen at least 
up to 130 s after the trigger. We performed spectral analysis in time 
interval of (-0.5, 60) s, covering the main part of GRB activity. The 
best fit is obtained for (Band model + thermal component) with following 
parameters: E_p = 758 +/- 13 keV, alpha = -1.21 +/- 0.01, beta = -2.54 
+/- 0.03 and thermal spectral component with kT = 13.9 +/- 0.3 keV. The 
fluence of F = (5.47 +/- 0.01)E-4 erg/cm**2 is obtained in 10 - 1000 keV 
energy band. The  parameter E_p = 758 +/- 13 keV is higher than 
preliminary value presented by GBM team (Mangan et al., GCN 31210) due 
to inclusion of the thermal component in the fit.

Assuming a redshift of z = 0.076 (Malesani et al., GCN 31221) we 
estimated E_iso = (1.161 +/- 0.006)E52 erg in the 1 keV - 10 MeV energy 
band. The burst is placed very close but outside the 2 sigma correlation 
region at E_p,i - E_iso and T_90,i - EH diagrams [1,2], see the Figures in

http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB211211A/GRB211211A_Ep-Eiso-2.png
http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB211211A/GRB211211A_EHD.png

Using T_90,i - EH diagram we found minimal possible redshift value of z 
= 0.080, very close to the redshift of z = 0.076 (Malesani et al., GCN 
31221). Therefore, we consider GRB 211211A as not a significant outlier.

The burst was also detected by SPI-ACS/INTEGRAL. Its duration in the 
SPI-ACS energy band (> 80 keV) is T_90 = 30.0 +/- 0.2 s, while the 
emission is seen up to 70 s. Comparing fluences of long-duration GRBs 
simultaneously recorded by SPI-ACS and Fermi/GBM (Chelovekov et al., in 
preparation) we estimated the GRB 211211A fluence to be 5.5E-4 erg/cm**2 
in the 10-1000 keV energy band (the 95% confidence region 1.6-4  1.9E-3 
erg/cm**2, incl. systematics). GRB 211211A is one of the brightest GRBs 
of SPI-ACS/INTEGRAL sample in terms of peak flux (about 40000 cnts/50 
ms). The SPI-ACS light curve of GRB 211211A can be found in

obtained 4x300 s frames in each of the B, V, R and I bands, and then 
2x1800 s spectroscopy covering ~3800 - 8800 AA.

The optical afterglow of the burst (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 31347) is 
clearly detected in each of our stacked images in the V, R and I bands, 
but no in the B band. Preliminary photometry is as follows:

The spectrum is in low resolution and rather low S/N. However, a broad 
absorption feature is evident centering at ~ 6820 AA, which can 
interpreted as Ly_alpha absorption. Besides Ly_alpha, other weak lines 
such as Si II, C II, Si IV are also detected at the common redshift of z 
= 4.61. We thus conclude that z = 4.61 is likely the redshift of the GRB.

On behalf a larger collaboration report:

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 220101A (Tohuvavohu et al., 
GCN 31347; Arimoto et al., GCN 31350) using the Asiago Copernico and Schmidt Robotic telescopes (INAF-OAPadova). 
The Copernico Telescope is equipped with the AFOSC spectrograph. A  low S/N spectrum was obtained starting on 2022-01-01 UT 22:21:03, covering the wavelength range 3400-8200 AA.

As reported by Fu at al., GCN 31353 and by Fymbo et al., GCN 31359, a deep, broad feature is detected around 6800 AA, interpreted as the damped Lyman alpha. Other narrow absorption lines are also detected, which allow to confirm the GRB redshift z = 4.61

The afterglow was observed starting on 2022-01-01 between 22:01 and 22:05 UT using Copernico Telescope with BV filters  and with gri Sloan filters (two series) using Schmidt 67/92 Robotic Telescope between 22:08 and 22:25 UT. 
The afterglow is detected in several individual images. 
We measure V-Bessel = 20.48 +/- 0.1 mag in the Copernico image taken at UT 22:01.

Malesani (Radboud U. Nijmegen and DAWN/NBI), S. Savaglio (UNICAL), on

We report the results of spectroscopic observations of two galaxies 
close to the position of the GRB (O'Connor et al. GCN #30934, Kann et 
al., GCN #30983) of the short GRB 210919A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 
#30846), obtained with the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) 
instrument mounted on the 2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt. Graham, AZ, USA). 
Spectra were obtained at a mid-time of 12:35 UT on 2021-10-16, ~27.5 
days after the burst trigger, for a total on-source time of 5400 s, 
covering the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA.

The MODS slit inclination was adjusted to cover the positions of the two 
objects singled out by O'Connor et al. (GCN #30934), with offsets of 
~3.4 and 13"" with respect to the candidate afterglow by Kann et al. 
(GCNs #30883 and #30884) respectively, and of the faint source at the 
eastern edge of the XRT error circle detected in the ESO-VLT/FORS2 
images (Kann et al., GCN #30983). This latter source was not detected in 
the MODS data. The spectra of the other two galaxies show several well 
detected emission lines which we interpret as [OII] 3727AA, H-beta, 
[OIII] 4959,5007AA and H-alpha at a common redshift for both sources of 
z=0.2411. The clear detection of these emission lines, and especially 
H-beta, indicates that these are two star forming galaxies.

At this redshift, the projected distances to the two galaxies at ~3.4"" 
and ~13"" from the afterglow corresponds to ~13 and ~50 kpc. The distance 
between the two galaxies corresponds to 63 kpc, similar to the distance 
between the Milky Way and the SMC. There is at least another galaxy (RA, 
DEC = 05:21:04.01, +01:18:49.23) within 0.5 arcmin with similar 
photometric redshifts (SDSS DR16), suggesting that the two galaxies are 
probably not isolated, but part of a larger group.

If GRB 210919A was at z = 0.2411, using standard cosmology (Planck 2016) 
and the analysis of the BAT spectra (Barthelmy et al., GCN #30863 and 
http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1073893/BA), we find that it would be 
consistent with the population of short GRBs in the Ep,i - Eiso plane.

We observed the field of GRB 220117A (Melandri et al., GCN 31466) using 
the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Our 
first observations were carried out using the acquisition camera, using 
the g, r and z filters (3x60 s in each band). Inside the XRT error 
circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 31472), we detect a new source, not 
visible in the archival Pan-STARRS images, which we identify as the GRB 
afterglow. The source is very red, being detected strongly in z, only 
weakly in r, and completely missing in g. Calibrated against nearby 
stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog, we measure z = 20.81 +- 0.12 mag and 
z - r ~ 2.1 mag (all AB magnitudes). The afterglow coordinates are 
(J2000, 0.2"" error):

RA = 06:06:17.409
Dec = -28:26:15.78

A spectrum was secured covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA, and 
consisting of 4 exposures of 1200 s each. The observation mid time was 
2022 Jan 18.15 UT (11.3 hr after the GRB).

In a preliminary reduction, continuum is detected in the red part of the 
spectrum down to ~7260 AA. We interpret the break as due to Lyman alpha. 
The absorption system is rather weak and, at the present time, we 
identify with confidence only the Lyman-alpha trough and the Si II 1260 
AA feature, which correspond to a redshift z = 4.961 for GRB 220117A.

The long GRB 220117A (Swift-BAT trigger #1093592, T0 = T0(BAT)= 16:18:51.546 UT:
Melandri et al. GCN 31466; Palmer et al., GCN 31485;
Fermi GBM Sub-Threshold Detection: Veres, GCN 31487)
was detected by Konus-Wind (KW) in the waiting mode.

A Bayesian block analysis of the KW waiting mode data in the 20-400 keV band
reveals a >10 sigma count rate increase over background in the interval
from ~T0+10 s to ~T0+50 s. No statistically significant
emission has been detected above 400 keV throughout the burst.
The KW light curve of this burst is available
at http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB220117A/

To derive broad-band spectral parameters of this burst, we performed
a joint spectral analysis of the Swift/BAT data (15-150 keV) and
the KW 3-channel spectral data (20-1500 keV).
A fit to the time-averaged spectrum, measured from  T0+10.557 s to T0+48.829 s,
by a power law with an exponential cutoff (CPL) model gives a photon index
alpha = -1.14 (-0.32,+0.37), and Ep = 71 (-11,+17) keV, chi^2 = 65.0/ 58 dof.
The Band GRB function fits this spectrum equally well, with alpha = -1.04 (-0.40,+0.58),
Ep = 65 (-14,+20) keV, and beta = -2.59 (-7.41, +0.43), chi^2 = 64.7/57 dof.
A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index of 1.89 (-0.08, +0.09), chi^2 = 72.4/ 59 dof.

In the 15-1500 keV band, the total burst fluence, estimated from the Band model,
is (2.8  0.7)x10^-6 erg/cm^2, and the 2.944 s peak energy flux is (1.7  0.4)x10^-7 erg/cm^2/s.

Assuming the redshift z=4.961 (Palmero et al., GCN 31480)
and a standard cosmology with H_0 = 67.3 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.315,
and Omega_Lambda = 0.685 (Planck Collaboration, 2014),
we estimate the isotropic energy release E_iso to (1.26  0.31)x10^53 erg,
which is consistent with that estimated from the GBM detection (GCN 31487),
the isotropic peak luminosity L_iso to (4.5  1.2)x10^52 erg/s,
and the rest-frame peak energy of the time-integrated spectrum Ep,z to 387(-84,+120) keV.
With the obtained estimates, GRB 220117A lies inside 68% prediction bands

The long GRB 211227A (Swift-BAT detection:
Beardmore et al., GCN 31316; Lien et al., GCN 31326;
MAXI/GSC detection: Tominaga et al., GCN 31319;
CALET-GRBM detection: Cherry et al., GCN 31333),
T0 (BAT) = 23:32:06.867, was detected by Konus-Wind (KW)
in the waiting mode.

A Bayesian block analysis of the KW waiting mode data in 25-400 keV range
reveals two episodes with count rate excess >10 sigma over background.
The first one, lasting from ~T0-50 s to ~T0-10 s, is due to the solar
activity and is not associated with the GRB.
The second episode, from ~T0-1.5 s to ~T0+81 s, is consistent in time
with the BAT detection. It has a double-peaked structure,
with the first, narrow pulse peaking at ~T0, and the second,
more broad pulse - at ~T0 + 11 s.

To derive broad-band spectral parameters of this burst,
we performed a joint spectral analysis of the Swift/BAT data (15-150 keV)
and the KW 3-channel spectral data (25-1700 keV).

A fit to the time-averaged spectrum, measured from T0-1.540 s to 
T0+83.836 s,
by the Band GRB function gives alpha = -1.34 (-0.08,+0.10),
beta = -2.26 (-1.11,+0.24), and Ep = 192 (-42,+45) keV; chi^2 = 48.5/ 57 
dof.

A fit to the spectrum near the peak KW count rate, measured from 
T0+10.236 s to T0+19.068 s,
by the Band function gives alpha = -1.09 (-0.07,+0.08), beta = -2.29 
(-0.11,+0.28),
and Ep = 374 (-70,+66) keV; chi^2 = 47.1/58 dof.

The spectrum of the short initial pulse, measured from T0-1.540 s to 
T0+4.348 s,
is well fit by a power law with an exponential cutoff (CPL), with
alpha = -1.56 (-0.06,+0.15) and Ep = 366 (-179,+1201) keV; chi^2 = 
49.3/59 dof.
Although the Band model fit to this spectrum is not constrained,
fixing beta to the value -2.26, obtained for the time-integrated spectrum,
gives alpha = -1.49 (-0.18, +0.24) and Ep = 240 (-116, +759) keV; chi^2 
= 49.0/59 dof.

In the 15-1500 keV band, the total burst fluence is 
2.60(-0.21,+0.21)x10^-5 erg/cm^2,
and the 64 ms peak energy flux is 2.0(-0.4,+0.4)x10^-6 erg/cm^2/s.

Assuming the redshift z=0.228 (Malesani et al., GCN 31324)
of the host galaxy candidate (Fu et al., GCN 31320),
and a standard cosmology with H_0 = 67.3 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.315,
and Omega_Lambda = 0.685 (Planck Collaboration, 2014),
we estimate the isotropic energy release E_iso to 4.9(-0.4,+0,4)x10^51 erg,
the isotropic luminosity L_iso to 4.7(-1.0,+1,0)x10^50 erg/s,
and the rest-frame peak energies of the time-integrated and peak spectra
to 235(-51,+56) keV and 460 (-86, +81) keV, correspondingly.
With these values, GRB 211227A is consistent with the 90% prediction 
bands for the 'Amati'
relation and is an outlier in the 'Yonetoku' relation for the sample of 
 >300 long KW GRBs
with known redshifts (Tsvetkova et al., 2021, ApJ, 908, 83).
However, if we assume a higher burst redshift (z>0.5), GRB 211227A is 
consistent
with both 'Amati' and 'Yonetoku' relations,

Data were obtained at ~12 UT on 2021-11-05, ~13 days (i.e. 9 rest-frame

Spectroscopy of the source was obtained for a total of 4x900 s, covering 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA. The spectrum has been corrected for 
Galactic extinction (A_V = 0.45 mag). The contribution of the host 
galaxy was removed via a galaxy template matching the emission line 
fluxes. The low S/N spectrum shows features similar to those exhibited 
by XRF-associated SN2006aj at a similar phase (Mazzali et al. 2006,

mounted on the UT3 of ESOs Very Large Telescope. The observation

consisted of 4x1200 s in the UVB and VIS arms and 8x600 s in the NIR 
arm. We used the JH-slit that blocks part of the K-band and in return 
increases the efficiency of the J and H bands, resulting in a wavelength 
coverage between 3000 to 21000 AA. 

In a preliminary reduction we detect two weak emission lines that we 
identify as [OII]3727 and [OIII] 5008, as well as a marginal detection of 
[OII]4960 at a common redshift of z=1.1137+/-0.0002. The other line of 
the OII doublet, [OII]3729 is affected by a sky line and is consequently 
not detected. H-alpha falls within a telluric absorption and H-beta in a 
spectral region of low sensitivity, both resulting in non detections. Given 
the spatial coincidence of these emissions with the afterglow, we identify 
the underlying object as the host galaxy and propose this as the redshift 
of the GRB.

The redshift and luminosity of this object, together with its X-ray

counterpart to GRB 990510 (Vreeswijk et al.; GCN #310) with the

lines are redshifted by z = 1.619 +- 0.002 (this may be a lower limit
to the redshift of the GRB source). On the basis of this redshift we
also find some weaker features, such as Al III (1863), Cr II/Zn II

the faint object visible in the archival optical images from the Legacy Survey,
coincident with the optical and X-ray afterglow, first noticed by
Rastinejad et al. (GCN 32208).

The observation was performed on 2022 September 23 (104 days after the GRB)
and consisted of 4x1200 s in the UVB and VIS arms and 8x600 s in the NIR arm.
A filter was adopted to block part of the K band which in return increases
the efficiency of the J and H bands, resulting in a wavelength coverage
between 3000 to 21000 AA.

In a preliminary reduction, we detect several strong emission lines that
we identify as Lyman-alpha, [O II] 3729, [O III] 4959 and [O III] 5007 at a
common redshift of z = 2.3608 +/- 0.0002. The [O II] 3726 and H-beta lines
are affected by sky lines and are consequently not clearly detected. H-alpha
falls outside the covered wavelength range.

This result is supported by a VLT/MUSE spectrum obtained on 2022 August 24,
covering the wavelength range 4800 to 9300 AA, which shows no emission nor
absorption features, consistent with the measured redshift from X-shooter.

The positional coincidence between our target and the optical and X-ray
afterglow suggests a physical association. Furthermore, our spectra show
that the archival counterpart is a star-forming galaxy, akin to a typical
long GRB host. Our observations bring thus evidence that the GRB was not
physically associated with the local, nearby galaxy MCG-06-10-007 at z = 0.049
(Cenko et al., GCN 32191), and their proximity is a chance coincidence.

We clearly detect the traces of both galaxies in the combined spectrum and
determine redshifts of z=0.731 for G1 and z=0.464 for G2 based on emission
lines of [OII], [OIII] Hb and Ha. Based on the distance from the X-ray
afterglow candidate we determined G1 to be the likely host of GRB 221006A

for its possible host galaxy.

using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter

 From the acquisition image, we measure for the optical counterpart a 
magnitude i = 19.89 +- 0.05 (AB; calibrated against Pan-STARRS), 4.45 
days after the Fermi/GBM trigger.

The continuum is still dominated by the afterglow. However, narrow 
emission lines can be seen from the host galaxy. We identify H alpha in 
the optical and Pa alpha in the near-infrared, at redshift z = 0.151, 
consistent with the one measured from the afterglow absorption features 
(de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 32648).

The H alpha FWHM is about 110 km s^-1. From the H alpha flux, corrected 
for Galactic extinction (A_V = 4.2 mag), we infer a SFR > 0.25 M_Sun

and slit losses).

We report the results of the spectroscopic follow-up observations of the 
afterglow of GRB 221009A (Dichiara et al., GCN 32632; Fermi GBM 
detection: Veres et al., GCN 32636). The optical spectra were obtained 
with the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) instrument mounted on 
the 2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt. Graham, AZ, USA) at 3 UT on 2022-10-18, 
8.56 days after the burst trigger. The spectra cover the wavelength 
range 3200-10000 AA, and we obtained a total of 6 exposures of 900 s.

After correction for the foreground Galactic extinction (E(B-V)=1.324, 
Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011), we find that the resulting spectrum is 
clearly dominated by the afterglow. We subtracted the afterglow 
contribution assuming a spectral slope -0.7 (using the convention F_nu ~ 
nu^-beta), anchored to the simultaneous NIR flux. This value has been 
obtained modeling the NIR light curve of the afterglow (Ferro et al., 
GCN 32804; D'Avanzo et al., GCN 32755). The remaining low S/N spectrum 
shows features typical of type Ic-BL supernovae. Therefore, we confirm 
the emerging contribution of SN 2022xiw (de Ugarte Postigo et al. et al.

The observations were obtained for a total integration time of approximately 1 hour, using the prism to obtain a spectrum in the range 0.5-5.5 um. The trace confirms the spectral shape measured from NIRCam observations. Blueward of 2 um, the source has a flat spectrum, but low signal to noise, and a strong upturn redward of 2 um. 

We note the presence of two weak, narrow emission features in the spectrum, both of which are offset from the trace by approximately 0.1-0.2"". These are consistent with the H-alpha and [O III] (5007 AA) emission lines at z = 3.87. Excess flux in the spectrum is also visible at the location of H-beta at this redshift. If the GRB is from a low redshift merger, as suggested by GCN 33569, then this could only be explained by a chance alignment with an unrelated background galaxy. It is hard to quantify this possibility, given that we could be seeing both transient and galaxy light, however the chances are clearly low.

Alternatively, the lines could be from the host galaxy, implying that GRB 230307A lies at z = 3.87. The very red colours of the continuum source would not naturally match the expectations of any afterglow models at z = 3.87, but in fact could be consistent with those of a dusty, red galaxy. Given only one epoch in the mid-IR is available, we cannot rule out this possibility, although such a galaxy would be extremely compact, and the transient would have to decay very steeply since the last ground-based observations. We note that, at this redshift, GRB 230307A would be by far the most energetic burst ever detected, with E_iso ~ 10^56 erg. This would be an order of magnitude more energetic than any of the ~500 GRBs with available isotropic energy releases.

We re-observed the field of GRB 230427A (Troja et al., GCN 33687) using 
the T193cm telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France) equipped 
with the MISTRAL spectro-imager. This time, we targeted in spectroscopy 
the galaxy close to the GRB line of sight: WISEA J101316.01+481158.7, at 
r'SDSS(PSF) = 19.6 (AB). Two exposures of 900s were obtained in the blue 
configuration (4200A-8000A) from 2023 28 April 00:25:02 UT to 2023 28 April 
00:55:59 UT. The wavelength calibration was performed using the MISTRAL 
calibration lamp, exposed just after the science observation. Data were 
reduced using the ASPIRED package (https://github.com/cylammarco/ASPIRED) 
configured for MISTRAL data.

In the combined frame, we clearly detect the [NII]@6548A, Halpha, [NII]@6583A, 
and [SII]@6718A. Halpha is the dominant line of the spectrum. Based on these 
lines, we inferred a redshift of z = 0.1524 +/- 0.0005, in good agreement 
with the SDSS photometric redshift of z = 0.13 +/- 0.03.

The GRB is at an offset of ~18 arcsec from the WISEA J101316.01+481158.7 
center. At the redshift of this galaxy, the burst would have a projected 
offset of ~48 kpc and a probability of chance coincidence of ~0.16, 
which is not commonly observed for the long GRB population. For this reason, 
this object is probably not the host galaxy of GRB 230427A.

The photometric calibration was performed using nearby stars from the PanSTARRS catalog and the magnitude is not corrected for Galactic extinction.

In addition, we exposed for 30min (2x15min) with the MISTRAL spectroscopic blue setting, covering from 4200A to 8000A, at R~750. We detect a faint continuum at the GRB position, clearly visible at wavelength redder than ~5100A, but the absence of continuum at Lambda bluer than 5100A may be due to the lack of efficiency of the instrument.

The spectrum shows a trace throughout the whole range, with a broad absorption feature at ~ 4150 AA, which can be interpreted as Lya at z~2.4. Redward several prominent absorption features are present, which can be interpreted as due to Si II, O I, C II, Si IV, C IV, Ni II, Fe II at a common redshift of z = 2.42, being consistent with the Lya feature. We thus think this is the redshift of the burst.

The optical spectra of the two candidate host galaxies were obtained with the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) instrument mounted on the 2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt. Graham, AZ, USA) on 2023-03-04, 27 days after the burst trigger. The spectra cover the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA, with a total of exposure time of 1.5 hours.

We detect a faint and red continuum with few emission lines for the brightest galaxy that we tentatively identify as H-alpha, and H-beta at a common redshift of z=0.429 (consistent with the photometric redshift of z = 0.484 ± 0.090 provided by SDSS, see Tomasella et al., GCN 33302). The spectral trace of the fainter galaxy is too weak to allow a reliable identification of any emission line, thus not permitting its redshift estimate.

Multiband photometry was also collected between June and July (4-5 months after the GRB trigger) in the r, z and H bands, with both galaxies detected in all filters. These images also show an additional fainter host galaxy candidate at coordinates 13:28:16.56 +46:43:34.7, underlining the complexity of the field.

The spectrum is consistent with those of very young supernovae that demonstrate flash-ionisation features a few hours to days after shock breakout (e.g. Gal-Yam et al. 2014, Nature, 509, 471). This is consistent with the non detection of the transient by ATLAS just 8 hours prior to the GOTO discovery. A comparison with SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that the best matching template is that of SN 1998S at 12 days before maximum. Based on photometry reported by Iglesias-López et al. (GCN 34881), the transient absolute magnitude is around M_r = -18.8 (AB).

Considering the large GRB uncertainty region (12.6 deg radius) and its short duration, GOTO23baj/AT2023vuc is likely unrelated to GRB 231024A. However, this is a very young supernova and further observations are encouraged.

We report observations of GRB 231111A (Melandri et al. GCN Circ. 34981) with the 3.6m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) equipped with DOLORES.

We acquired a spectrum of the optical source reported by Melandri et al. (GCN Circ. 34981). We obtained 2x1200 s with the LR-B grism, for a total exposure of 2400 s, covering the wavelength range 3500 - 8000 AA. The observations started on 2023-11-11 at 19:31:33 UT (i.e. about 5.2 hours after the GRB detection).  

The reduced spectrum is rather noisy and extends down to at least 3600 AA, indicating that the redshift is likely lower than z ~ 2. From preliminary reduction and calibration we tentatively infer a redshift of z ~ 1.39 from the possible detection of MgII 2796,2803. 
Further analysis is ongoing. ",z ~ 1.39,GRB 231111A,Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG),Spectroscopic

We observed the afterglow of GRB 231111A (Melandri et al. GCN 34981, Jiang et al. GCN 34982) with OSIRIS+ at the 10.4m GTC on Nov. 11, 2023, starting at 20:19:13 UT, 6h after the GRB. We obtained 3x900s exposures under bad seeing conditions (1.9 arcsec) using the R1000B grism, which gives a wavelength coverage between 3700 and 7800 A. At the time of observations, the afterglow had a magnitude of r~20.2 as determined from the acquisition image.

In the combined spectrum we detect the MgII 2796,2803 Å doublet and faint lines of FeII 2585 and 2600 Å, which results in a redshift of z=1.179. TNG (D’Avanzo et al. GCN 35007) also claims the detection of a MgII doublet, however, at their reported redshift of z=1.39, no lines are present in our spectrum. No fine-structure lines are detected, making the redshift of 1.179 strictly seen as a lower limit. However, given the lack of further emission or absorption features in the spectral range and the upper limit of z~2 due to the detection of continuum down to 3650 Å (similar to the claim of D'Avanzo et al. GCN 35007) we expect this to be the actual redshift of the GRB.

In a 30s image taken with the acquisition camera on Nov 19 00:51:23 UT, we clearly detect the optical afterglow (Dutton et al., GCN 35103, GCN 35108; Lipunov et al., GCN 35109; Strausbaugh et al., GCN 35110; Shrestha et al, GCN 35113), for which we measure an AB magnitude r = 19.88 +/- 0.04 mag (calibrated against one nearby star from Legacy Survey).

In a preliminary reduction, we clearly detect a continuum over the entire wavelength range. From detection of multiple absorption features, which we interpret as being due to FeII, MnII, MgII, MgI and FeII*, ZnII, CrII, and CaII, we infer a common redshift of z = 0.8304.  We conclude this is the redshift of the burst. We also detect multiple emission lines (Halpha, Hbeta, OIII doublet) at a consistent redshift, which we interpret as being due to the GRB host galaxy.

We have measured the flux of the GRB 050607 optical
afterglow (Rhoads 2005, GCNC 3527) in our five I band images
from t=640 to t=6330 seconds post-burst.
A power law decay with slope -0.5 gives a marginally acceptable
fit to the I band light curve.  A better fit can be obtained by
a two-part power law, with an initial steep decay (exponent near
-1) up to t ~ 1700 seconds, followed by a flatter decay (exponent
near -0.3) from 1700 to 6300 seconds.
The overall optical decay slope is in good agreement
with the X-ray slope reported by Pagani et al (GCNC 3528).

We also obtained images of Landolt standard field SA 113.  
We found a zero point error in our earlier photometry (GCNC 3527).
Our new zero point based on our standard star observations
gives a brighter afterglow magnitude at t=640 seconds:
 I = 21.46 +- 0.1 (statistical) +- 0.3 (systematic)

The remaining systematic error will go away with a more
careful reduction.  As a consistency check we find magnitude
I=16.2 for the star USNO 0975-17511046 (our astrometric
reference at 20:00:42.703 +9:08:34.98), which has USNO
tabulated magnitude Rmag=16.6 and B-R=0.7.

In addition to our I band data, we also monitored the burst
in B band and took smaller amounts of data in R, z, and g.
All data discussed here were obtained with the Mosaic 1 camera on 
the 4m Mayall Telescope of the Kitt Peak National Observatory.
Observations started at 2005 June 7 UT 09:20:46, and continued
until 11:18 UT.

The transient is faint in the B filter.  Our first B band epoch,
of 150 seconds centered at t=1384 seconds, does not show the afterglow
clearly.  A formal aperture flux measurement at the transient location
yields flux 0.7 +- 0.25 microJansky, or B ~ 24.4 +- 0.4.  This gives
an estimated spectral power law slope of f_nu ~ nu^-1.5 or steeper,
where we have accounted for the Galactic reddening based on the Schlegel
et al prediction (A_V = 0.6 mag, E(B-I) = 0.44 mag).
The faint B image is thus suggestive of a Lyman break in the spectrum,
though we cannot rule out a red power law with our present analysis.
We detect the transient at R band, placing a rough redshift bound z<5,
We do not detect it in our less sensitive z band images (suggesting
that the power law slope is not extremely red).

We observed the field of the MAXI/GSC GRB 240225B (Nakajima et al., GCN 35796; see also Joshi et al. 2024, GCN 35798; Kawakubo et al., GCN 35811) using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA, and consist of 4 exposures of 1200 s each. The observation mid-time is 02:29:56 UT on 2024 Feb 29 (~3.3 days after the MAXI trigger).

In grz images taken with the acquisition camera on Feb 29 01:37:53 UT, we clearly detect the optical afterglow (Gompertz et al., GCN 35805; Liu et al., GCN 35812; Malesani et al., GCN 35819; Wise et al., GCN 35820; Gompertz et al., GCN 35824; Pankov et al., GCN 35826; Moskvitin et al., GCN 35828; Mo et al., GCN 35829; Ror et al., GCN 35830; Sasada et al., GCN 35831), for which we measure a preliminary AB magnitude r ~ 21 (the absolute calibration is uncertain due to the low number of Pan-STARRS calibrators in our small FoV).

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we clearly detect a continuum over the entire wavelength range. From detection of multiple absorption features, which we interpret as being due to Fe II, Mg II, AlIII, Ca II, and Fe II*, we infer a common redshift of z = 0.946. We conclude this is the redshift of the burst. We also detect emission lines ([O II] and [O III] doublets, and H_alpha) at a consistent redshift, which we interpret as being due to the GRB host galaxy. As noted by Gompertz & Malesani (GCN 35824), the host galaxy is also detected in the Legacy Survey with r ~ 24.2 and a photometric redshift z ~ 0.9, which is consistent with the value we measured.

report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed a candidate host galaxy of GRB 050709 with the Gemini
North telescope and GMOS spectrograph at 2005 July 13.58 UT.  The
observations were made under clouds, at high airmass, and with morning
twilight interfering with the some of the observations.

The source acquired is the brighter of the two sources reported by
Jensen et al. (GCN #3589; ""Source B"").  The long slit likely does not
cover the position of the fainter of the two sources which is coincident
with the Chandra source (""Source A"").

We have reduced 2x900 sec integrations and identify emission lines at
approximate observed wavelengths of 7617A and 5810A which we associate
with Halpha and [O III]5007 at an approximate redshift of z = 0.16.
Fainter emission lines are observed at 5754A and 5641A, corresponding to
[O III]4959 and Hbeta, and thus we believe the redshift is secure.

If source A is the afterglow of GRB 050709, then it is seen in
projection about 3 kpc from Source B, suggesting that Source B may be
the host galaxy.  The similarity of this case with the previous
potential association of the short/hard GRB 050509B with a low-redshift
galaxy (Bloom et al., GCN #3386) is suggestive.  If GRB 050709 is at z =
0.16, then the isotropic-equivalent energy release is about 6 x 10^49
erg (based on Butler et al., GCN #3570).

A definitive measurement of the distance scale to short/hard GRBs awaits
the demonstration of variability of the X-ray or optical emission.  We
encourage deep observations to ascertain the nature of Source A and, in
particular, to search for variability.

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 240419A (Siegel et al., GCN 36169; Schneider et al., GCN 36175) using the ESO VLT UT2 (Kueyen) equipped with the UVES high-resolution spectrograph. Observations were automatically performed via the rapid-response mode (RRM) system. The observations consisted of a series of spectra taken on April 19 with the first one starting at 02:15:42 UT (27.7 min after the GRB). The spectra cover a wavelength range from 3700 to 9300 AA and were obtained at a relatively high airmass of 2.4.

In the spectrum of 700 s, we only detect a continuum in the upper chip of the red arm (7770 to 9300 AA). From the detection of multiple absorption features, which we interpret as being due to SII, OI, Si II, Si II*, CII, CII*, Si IV, we infer a common redshift of z = 5.178. We conclude this is the redshift of the burst. This is consistent with the absence of flux in the blue dichroic, which covers the wavelength range from 3300 to 5000 AA, and which is entirely blue-ward of the Lyman break at z = 5.178.

We obtained observations of the location of the X-ray transient LXT 240402A (Xu et al., GCN 36016; Jia et al., GCN 36022; Levan et al., GCN 36025), coincident with GRB 240402B detected by GECAM-C (Xue et al., GCN 36017) and Konus-Wind (Ridnaia et al., GCN 36028), using the X-shooter spectrograph at the VLT. Observations began at 04:04 (UT) on 03 May 2024, approximately 31 days after the trigger. The spectrum covers a wavelength range roughly 0.31 to 2.1 mum, with a total integration time of 4800 s.

A weak continuum is seen throughout the spectrum, and we clearly detect emission lines of [O II], H-beta, [O III], H-alpha, and tentatively Ly-alpha, at a common redshift of z = 1.551. We propose that these lines are from the host of the transient. Based on the gamma-ray fluence seen by Konus-Wind in the 20 keV - 10 MeV band (Ridnaia et al., GCN 36028) we conclude an isotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays of 4.7x10^52 erg. This places it very close to the mean Amati relationship (Amati et al. 2006 MNRAS 372 233), and thus is consistent with a long-GRB origin.

report:

We have performed a joint fit to the WXM and FREGATE spectral data
for GRB 050709, in order to refine the numbers initially reported in
GCN 3570 (Butler et al. 2005) for the short and long pulse components.

The short pulse is well-fit (chi2/DOF= 35.37/48) by a power-law times
exponential model with photon index alpha = -0.7 +/- 0.2 and nu-F_nu peak
energy Epeak = 83 +18/-12 keV.  The energy fluences of the short pulse
are

S_E(2-30 keV)   = (9.3 +/- 0.9) x 10^(-8) erg cm^-2 and
S_E(30-400 keV) = (2.9 +/- 0.4) x 10^(-7) erg cm^-2.

The X-ray to gamma-ray fluence ratio is thus 0.32.  The t90 duration of
the short pulse is 220 +/- 50 ms in the 2-25 keV energy band and 70 +/- 10
ms in the 30-400 keV band.  The t90 duration and Epeak of the short
pulse are consistent with those found for short/hard GRBs (see, e.g.,
Ghirlanda, Ghisellini, & Celotti 2004, A&A, 422, L55 for plots of the
short/hard GRB Epeak distribution).

The long pulse is well fit (chi2/DOF = 108.86/138) by a power-law model
with photon index beta = -2.2 +0.2/-0.4.  The energy fluences of the
long pulse are

S_E(2-30 keV)   = (7.1 +/- 1.5) x 10^(-7) erg cm^-2 and
S_E(30-400 keV) = (3.9 +4.1/-2.7) x 10^(-7) erg cm^-2.

These spectral results are preliminary because there is a linear trend
in the background that affects the spectral analysis of the long pulse
and has not yet been taken into account.  The t90 of the long pulse is
130 +/- 7 s in the 2-25 keV energy band.

Using the redshift of z = 0.16 measured by Price et al. (2005; GCN 3605),
the isotropic-equivalent energy of the short pulse in the 1-10,000 keV
energy band in the rest frame of the source is

Eiso (short pulse) = (2.7 +1.1/-0.3) x 10^(49) erg,

using Omega_M=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7, and h=0.65.  The Eiso and Epeak
values for the short pulse place it well off of the Amati et al. (2002;
A&A, 390, 81) relation for long duration GRBs.

Taking a time interval 0.060 s in the rest frame of the source
(corresponding to t90 = 0.07 s in the 30-400 keV energy band in the
observer frame) and assuming the same cosmology and energy band as
used above for the Eiso determination, the luminosity of the short
pulse in the 1-10,000 keV energy band in the rest frame of the source
is

Liso (short pulse) = (5.2 +/- 1.4) x 10^(50) erg s^-1.

Taking even this short time interval, the Liso and Epeak values for the
short pulse place it off the Yonetoku et al. (2004; ApJ, 609, 935)
correlation for long duration GRBs.

2-25 keV and 30-400 keV bands can be found at

The observation had a mean epoch 2024-05-30T04:05:55 UT (1.0468 days after the burst onset).

We have obtained GMOS/R400 spectroscopy (2400s) of the Sources
identified as A, B and D in GCN #3672.  We confirm
the identification of Source B as a Galactic star
(GCN #3675).  We tentatively identify Source A as a
Galactic star based on its PSF and featureless spectrum.

Our acquisition image of the field clearly demonstrates
that Source D is extended and therefore a galaxy.  Our
spectrum of the galaxy is nearly featureless
(lambda=5000-9000A), indicating the galaxy is an early
type consistent with its red color (GCN #3673).
We assign a possible redshift of z=0.257 based on
absorption features at ~6510A and ~7415A which we
associate with MgI and NaI.  The galaxy is located
7.2"" from the refined XRT position (GCN #3678) which
would correspond to 27kpc at z=0.257.

Further observations are encouraged.

The observation was performed on 2024 July 02 (13.8 days after the GRB). It consisted of 4 exposures of 600 s each and covered the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA.

The target is faintly detected in the r-band acquisition image, with an AB magnitude r ~ 22.8 (calibration is difficult due to paucity of calibrators in the field). This is significantly brighter than the archival object visible in the Pan-STARRS and Legacy surveys, first noticed by Gompertz et al. (GCN 36715), and likely includes a transient contribution.

In a preliminary reduction, we detect several strong emission lines that we identify as  H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, the [O II] doublet, [O III] 4959, [O III] 5007, and [Ne III] 3869 at a common redshift of z = 0.3965, which is lower than the photometric value reported in the PS1-STRM catalog (Beck et al. 2020) for galaxy PSO J162.3946+17.2828. We therefore propose this to be the redshift of the GRB.

The Legacy survey images also show a second, fainter object about 1.7"" west of the optical afterglow position. This was also included in the slit, and we measure for it z = 1.338 from detection of [O II] and H-alpha. Given the larger offset, we consider this galaxy to be unrelated to the GRB.

In a preliminary reduction, we clearly detect continuum over the entire wavelength range. From detection of multiple absorption features, which we interpret as due to Fe II, Mg II, C IV, Al lI and Si II, we infer a common redshift of z = 1.494. No emission lines from the underlying host galaxy are detected in a preliminary analysis. This redshift is perfectly consistent with the value by Gottumukkala et al. (GCN 37122). We thus confirm that z = 1.494 is the redshift of GRB 240809A. We also note the presence of additional absorption features, likely due to an intervening system at z = 0.844.

Spectra of the afterglow of GRB 050730 (Holland et al. GCN 3704)
were obtained with the Magellan Observatory Baade Telescope and
IMACS imaging spectrograph beginning 2005 July 30 23:57 (UT).
The spectra cover 360 to 950 nm with a dispersion of 0.74 A/pix.
We find a clear Ly-alpha absorption system with the GRB flux
reaching zero between 598 nm and 609 nm.  This confirms the
redshift of 3.97 found for the burst by Chen et al.
(GCN 3709) and Rol et al. (GCN 3710).

An image of the GRB field was obtained July 30 23:10 (UT) with

Xu (NAOC), report on behalf of the Stargate collaboration:

Following the identification of the optical afterglow (Quirola-Vasquez et al., GCN 37319) of GRB 240821A (Cangemi et al., GCN 37220; He et al., GCN 37226; Murphy et al., GCN 37232; Dalessi & Meegan, GCN 37239), we obtained 4x1200 s of observations with the X-shooter instrument at the ESO VLT UT3 (mid time 2024 Aug 30.3578 UT, that is, 8.8 days after the trigger). These observations reveal a continuum across the spectral range 4000-20000 AA, and a single clear emission line at 8120 AA. While the presence of a substantial continuum blueward of 8120 AA rules out that this line is Ly-alpha, it is difficult to conclusively determine a redshift value based on only a single line. We consider three possibilities below. 


A) The emission line could arise from the [O II] doublet (3726, 3729) at z = 1.18. In this scenario the other strong emission lines lie in the IR regime, where sensitivity is poorer and sky background higher. The observed spectral energy distribution of the host galaxy from the Legacy and VISTA surveys would also provide the best match at this redshift. However, the resolution of X-shooter should clearly resolve the two components of the doublet, and, while a very weak excess may be present at 8215 AA (the expected location of the bluer component of the doublet), the observed intensity ratio would be inconsistent with the expectations for either high or low density media.

B) The line could be from [O III] (5007 AA) at z = 0.62. In this scenario, both [O III] 4959 and H-beta would lie in close proximity in the spectrum, although are expected to have lower flux, and hence poorer signal to noise than the observed line. There is no detection of any emission at the expected location of either. 

C) The line may come from H-alpha at z = 0.24. Since H-alpha may well be the brightest line within the host galaxy (especially for a short-GRB host), the non-detection of other emission features at the same redshift, but at bluer wavelengths is less problematic because they may be fainter and/or extinguished. This may also be supported by an apparent decrease in the galaxy continuum at ~4500 AA, which could be due to the Balmer break, although the signal to noise is poor in this region.

The detection of a single line does not enable at the current time an unambiguous redshift determination, but does suggest it must be one of the above possibilities. We note that all of these lie outside the formal 1-sigma range of the photometric redshift determination from the Legacy survey (z = 0.488 +/- 0.074; Zhou et al. 2021, MNRAS, 501, 3309). Further analysis is ongoing, and we will update the community should this reveal a stronger conclusion regarding the burst redshift.

300V, R~800; UVES, R~40,000, 7.5 km/s in the observer frame) of the
optical afterglow of GRB050730 (Holland et al., GCN 3704). The
observations consisted of 2 exposures for a total of 1800 second with
FORS1 and 2 exposures for a total of 6000 seconds with UVES covering the
full spectral range 3500-9800 Angstrom. 

At the time of the observations the afterglow magnitude was R~17.7 and
the decay of the afterglow, as measured from the FORS1 flux-calibrated
spectra, is consistent with a temporal decay index of about -1. For the
UVES spectra, the resulting continuum signal to noise per resolution
element spans from 10 to 20 in the 6000-9000 Angstrom range.

features reported by the GRAASP collaboration (GCN 3709 and 3732). We

The observation was performed on 2024 September 16 (23.1 hr after the GRB), and consisted of 4 exposures of 600 s each covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA.

In images taken with the acquisition camera, the optical afterglow is well detected. In the r band, we measure an AB magnitude of r ~ 19.4, calibrated against three nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog. This magnitude is significantly fainter than that reported by Jiang et al. (GCN 37526), confirming the fading nature of this object and thus the identification of this source as the afterglow of GRB 240916A.

In a preliminary analysis of the spectra, we clearly detect continuum over the entire wavelength range. A trough is visible around 4350 AA, which we identify as due to HI Lyman-alpha absorption. In addition, from detection of a plethora of absorption features, which we interpret as being due to O I, O I*, Si II, Si II*, C II, C II*, Si IV,  C IV, Fe II, Fe II*, Cr II, Zn II, Ni II, Ni II*, Mn II, Mg II, we infer a common redshift of z = 2.610, which we conclude is the redshift of GRB 240916A. There is a tentative detection of H-beta emission at z=2.610 from the underlying host galaxy. We also note the presence of an additional intervening absorption system at z = 2.214.

We observed the optical counterpart of the SVOM/ECLAIRs GRB 241001A (Schanne et al., GCN 37655) using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA, and consist of 4 exposures of 1200 s each. The observations mid-time is 07:11:17 UT on 2024 October 02 (~14 hours after the SVOM timeTb).


In a 60 s image taken with the acquisition camera, we detect the optical afterglow (Izzo & Malesani, GCN 37673), for which we measure an AB magnitude r = 22.3 (calibrated against nearby stars from the Legacy Survey DR10 catalog).


In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we detect a continuum over the entire wavelength range. From the detection of multiple absorption features, which we interpret as due to Fe II and Mg II, we infer a common redshift of z = 0.5727. We also detect bright emission lines ([O II] and [O III] doublets, and Hbeta) at a consistent redshift of z = 0.5730, which we interpret as being due to the GRB host galaxy. We conclude that GRB 241001A is at z = 0.573.

Report on behalf of the SVOM team:

Considering the excellent followup for GRB 241001A detected and localized by SVOM/ECLAIRs (GCN 37655), and the redshift measured by the VLT (z = 0.573, GCN 37677), we provide here a spectral analysis showing that this transient qualifies as an X-Ray Flash (XRF). 

The following properties have been measured in the 5 - 20 keV energy range (no count is detected beyond 20 keV).
T90 [s] = 11.7 (-4.4 / +2.0)
Fluence [erg cm-2] =  7e-8
Spectral parameters for a broken power law fit (red. chisqr = 0.86): 
gamma_1 = -1.7 (-0.6 / +1.3) 
E_break [keV] = 9.96 (-2.60 / +2.77)
gamma_2 = -5.4 (-2.2 / +1.9)
With these parameters, the fluence ratio [2-30]/[30-400] keV ≈ 340, well above 1, the empirical limit used to define X-Ray Flashes (Sakamoto et al. 2005). 

Moreover:
- A pure PL fit is rejected with high significance (red. chisqr = 2.9), indicating that the spectrum requires a cutoff at a few keV.
- A BB fit is fully acceptable (and preferred over the broken PL, with red. chisqr = 0.56), the best fit temperature is kT=1.8 +/- 0.2 keV

ECLAIRs being in the commissioning phase, the quoted spectral results shall be taken with some caution. In any case, the XRF classification is certain. 

The Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is a China-France joint mission led by the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), French Space Agency (CNES), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), which is dedicated to observing gamma-ray bursts and other transient phenomena in the energetic universe.

We observed the location of the SVOM and Fermi short GRB 240821A (Cangemi et al., GCN 37220; He et al., GCN 37226; Murphy et al., GCN 37232; Dalessi & Meegan, GCN 37239, Quirola-Vasquez et al., GCN 37319) with the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) as a follow-up to our previous VLT/X-shooter observation (Saccardi et al., GCN 37369). The observation consisted of two consecutive observations of 4x1200 s each, with mid-times at 03:53:33 UT and 05:18:58 UT on 2024 October 1 (~40.4 days after the trigger). The seeing delivered is significantly better than for our previous observation reported in GCN 37369.

In addition to the emission line at 8120 AA mentioned by Saccardi et al. (GCN 37369), which is clearly detected also in the new spectra, two fainter features are also visible. This allows solving the conundrum from the previous observation, as the three lines nicely match [O II] 3729, H alpha, and [N II] 6584, all at a common redshift z = 0.238.

Observations were carried out using the NIRSpec instrument on 2024-10-23, 21.5 days after trigger (13.7 days in the GRB rest frame). The total integration time was 1.7 hours with the clear prism in the wavelength range 0.5 - 5.5 µm.

The trace reveals a blue spectrum showing multiple broad absorption/emission features, similar to those observed in broad-lined type-Ic SNe commonly associated with long-duration GRBs. In particular, the spectrum matches well the one of GRB980425 / SN1998bw at 14 - 21 rest-frame days after collapse (Patat et al. 2001, Apj, 555, 900).

lines are present, including Mg II 2796, 2803 Ang doublets at redshifts of
0.456, 0.862, 1.302, and 1.411. We conclude that the redshift of the GRB is

""We imaged the field of GRB 050813 (GCN 3788) with the PANIC IR camera on
the Magellan/Baade 6.5-m telescope starting on 2005 Aug. 14.017 UT.
Observations were obtained with the K-s and Y-Carnegie filters, under poor
conditions (variable thick clouds, bright moonlight, and poor seeing of
~1"").  Initial processing of these data suggest that this line of sight is
centered on a high-redshift galaxy cluster.  A composite Y-K color image,
as well as a greyscale image of the stacked K frame is shown at:

        http://www.ociw.edu:/~eberger/grb050813_panic.jpg

The apparent centrally concentrated population of faint galaxies with red
and uniform colors is strongly suggestive of a galaxy cluster, and looks
similar to extensive data taken with this instrument on known high-z
galaxy clusters from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (Gladders & Yee
2005). The apparent size of the core of this distribution (~1 arcmin) and
the magnitude of the objects suggest this putative cluster is at high
redshift (above z=0.5, and likely at z~1). The objects noted as B and C by
Gorosabel et al. (GCN 3796) in the XRT error circle are both red and
likely cluster ellipticals, and both are approximately K=19, based on an
initial calibration of the image to the 2MASS magnitude of the bright star
to the immediate SE of these objects.

Given the low probability of a chance coincidence we suggest that GRB
050813 most likely occurred in the cluster environment.  This supports
recent associations of short GRBs with old galaxies (050509b: Bloom et al.
astro-ph/0505480; 050724: Berger et al. astro-ph/0508115).  The likely
higher redshift compared to the latter two events may also explain the

No clear DLA trough is visible, but several, low S/N absorption features are present to the red of the drop, which we tentatively interpret as Si II 1526, Si IV 1393, C IV 1548,1550 (blended), Al II 1670, Al III 1854,1862 at z = 2.82, which we propose as the redshift of GRB 241030B.",2.82,GRB 241030B,GTC (10.4 m),Spectroscopic

this redshift, given K~19 mag, galaxies B and C are about 0.5 L* compared

The observation was conducted with the Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) 2.4m telescope. Grism #3 was used, providing a wavelength coverage of 3400–9100 AA. A single 1-hour spectrum was obtained, with exposure beginning at 13:15:33 UT on 2024-10-30, about 7.46 hours after the Swift trigger.

Despite the low signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, we identified a strong absorption line of Al II at 1671 AA, along with weaker absorption lines of Fe II at 2374 AA, 2383 AA, 2587 AA, and 2600 AA, Mg II at 2800 AA, and Mg I at 2852 AA. These metal absorption features consistently indicate a redshift of z ~ 1.4, consistent with the Keck/LRIS result (Zheng et al., GCN 37959).

on Aug 14.35 UT with GMOS on Gemini-North under program GN-2005B-Q-6 and
originally reported in GCN 3801 by Berger.  Inspection of the spectrum of
galaxy X shows it to be at redshift z = 0.722 (consistent with the
redshift listed in GCN 3801 for galaxies B and C) with obvious Ca H&K and
G-band absorption but no signs of H gamma or H beta absorption.
Inspection of the spectrum of galaxy B shows it to be at redshift z =
0.718 with obvious Ca H&K absorption, but again, no signs of H gamma or H
beta absorption. Inspection of the spectrum of galaxy C shows it to not
definitively be at z = 0.722.  Although there are broad dips in the
spectrum which may correspond to Ca H&K at z = 0.722, there are other
features which conflict with this conclusion.  There are narrow emission
lines at 7353 and 7519 A observed (which would be 4270 and 4367 A at z =
0.722).

The Ca H&K lines of galaxy X have a velocity width of 591 +/- 97 km/s.
The presence of G-band absorption and a lack of emission lines points
towards an old stellar population.  The Ca H&K lines of galaxy B have a
width of 340 +/- 93 km/s.  There is also a strong (EW_observed = -6.0 A)
unidentified absorption line at 7402 A.  If we place this line at the
redshift of the galaxy, we notice that this could be Ti I 4305.  There is
an offset of 116 km/s between the line and the fiducial redshift if this
is the correct identification.  Another possibility is this line is due to

On 2024 November 2, once the field became visible to ground-based observatories, we secured spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy using the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) equipped with the OSIRIS+ instrument. Three spectra of 900 s each were obtained, using the R1000R grism, which covers the wavelength range 5150-10200 AA.

We used the FORS2 spectrograph mounted on the ESO VLT UT1 (Antu), equipped with grisms 300V (without order-sorting filter) and 300I (with filter OG590). The exposure time was 600 s per grism. Spectroscopy started on 2024 November 6.133 UT (about 11.08 hr after the trigger), and was carried out through moderately good seeing conditions (1"").

In the acquisition image, we measure a preliminary magnitude R = 20.10 +/- 0.10 (Vega), calibrated using archival FORS2 zeropoints.

From a preliminary reduction of the 300V spectrum, a continuum is detected over the wavelength range 4600 to 8700 AA. A trough due to Lya absorption is visible at the blue end. From the detection of multiple absorption features, which we interpret as due to C II, C IV, Si II, Si IV, Al II, Al III and Fe II, we infer a redshift of z = 2.681.

Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA, and consist of 4 exposures of 600 s each. The observation mid-time was 2024 Dec 9.302 UT (1.66 hr after the GRB).

From a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we do not detect any continuum. Emission lines are detected in the visible and near-infrared arms, which we identify as Halpha, [OIII] 5007 AA and the [OII] 3726, 3729 AA doublet at a common redshift of z = 1.490. No absorption lines are identified due to the faintness of the source (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 38484) and the low S/N of the spectra.

We notice that the recently released UVOT-enhanced X-ray position (Evans et al., GCN 38486) encompasses both this object and the brighter galaxy mentioned by de Ugarte Postigo et al.

The fainter one, which was favoured by the initial X-ray localisation (Page et al., GCN 38479) has a redshift of z=1.490, as measured with X-shooter/VLT (Saccardi et al., GCN 38487). The inclusion of the brighter one within the refined X-ray error box, makes it a more likely candidate host for the GRB, because of a lower chance coincidence, as already mentioned by Saccardi et al. The candidate NIR counterpart reported by Schneider et al. (GCN 38506) also lies within the extension of the brighter galaxy. Should it be confirmed to fade, this would also favour this as the GRB host.

We obtained spectroscopy of this, brighter and more likely host galaxy candidate (located at RA = 10:21:35.09, Dec = +06:19:45.4) using OSIRIS+ mounted on the 10.4m GTC telescope, at the Roque de los Muchachos observatory, on the island of La Palma (Spain). The observation consisted of 3x900s using grism R1000R, which has a spectral coverage between 5100 and 10000Å at a resolving power of 670.

The spectrum shows continuum over the complete range and bright emission features that we identify as due to [OII], H-beta and [OIII] as well as CaII H and K absorptions at a common redshift of z = 0.784, which we identify as the redshift of the most likely host galaxy of GRB 241209A.

The observation consisted of 4x1200 s with a mid-time at 2024-12-18 06:52.46 UT (13.93 hr after the trigger).

In images taken with the acquisition camera, the counterpart is detected with AB magnitude r = 23.44 +/- 0.11 (mid time 13.1 hr after the trigger), which is about 1 mag brighter than the archival value from the Legacy Survey (r = 24.35 +/- 0.14). The target contained thus a mix of both afterglow and host galaxy light.

From a preliminary reduction of the spectra, a faint continuum is detected in the NIR arm from 10500 to 18000 AA, likely due to the afterglow. A single emission line is very significantly detected in the near-infrared arm at 14410 AA. We note that this wavelength region is severely affected by telluric absorption, whose effect could slightly shift the observed line centroid. No other strong lines are confidently detected. 

The likely interpretation is that the emission line is from [O III] 5007 AA at z = 1.879. At this redshift, other commonly observed emission lines, Halpha, Hbeta and [O III] 4959 all fall in regions of strong telluric absorption. A marginal detection of an emission line at 18990 AA is consistent with Halpha strongly attenuated by telluric absorption at this redshift. A low-significance emission feature can also be seen corresponding to [O II] 3729.

An alternative scenario would be that the emission line is due to Halpha at z = 1.196. In this case, we would expect to detect [O III] 5007 around 11000 AA, a region free from telluric absorption. Significant dust extinction must be invoked to suppress it and the other nebular lines.

The photometric redshift determination of the extended object visible in the Legacy Survey (z = 1.20 +/- 0.48; Zhou et al. 2021, MNRAS, 501, 3309) does not allow to strongly discriminate between the two values. We also warn that for such a faint object the Legacy Survey photometric redshifts are prone to systematic errors.

Even if the detection of a single line is ambiguous for redshift determination, we view the option z = 1.879 as the more likely scenario and we propose it as being the redshift of GRB 241217A / EP241217b. Further analysis is ongoing, and we will update the community should this reveal a stronger conclusion regarding the burst redshift.

At the location of the optical afterglow (Qiu et al., GCN 38516, GCN 38568) of the SVOM GRB 241209B (Xie et al., GCN 38478; see also DeLaunay et al., GCN 38428; Dafcikova et al., GCN 38534; Ridnaia et al., GCN 38537), a faint object is visible in the Legacy Survey r-band image (its detection in the g and i bands is marginal at best). We measure r = 23.52 +/- 0.12 mag (AB) calibrated against nearby Pan-STARRS objects. This is likely the GRB host galaxy.

A spectrum of this object was secured using OSIRIS+ on the 10.4 m GTC telescope, at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain) on the 11th December 2024 (2.06 days after the burst). Blind offsets were used to perform acquisition. The observation consisted of 3 spectra of 1200 s each, using grism R1000R which provides coverage over the spectral range 5100-10200 AA at a resolution R ~ 700.

On top of faint continuum, a single emission line is detected at the observed wavelength of 5872 AA. We discuss possible interpretations of this feature.

(A) The line is unlikely to be [O III] 5008 at z = 0.173, as the galaxy would be very faint and we see no hint of [O III] 4959 nor Halpha.

(B) The line could be the [O II] doublet at z = 0.575. At this redshift, Halpha falls out of the covered range, Hbeta lands in the telluric A band and [O II] 5008 in a region affected by strong sky line residuals. We believe this to be the most favoured solution, but the lack of [O III] detection, could imply that it is fainter than [O II], which is uncommon for both short and long GRB host galaxies (Kruehler et al. 2014, A&A, 581, A125; Fong et al. 2022, ApJ, 940, 56).

(C) The feature could be Ly-alpha at z = 3.831. At this redshift, the galaxy would have an unprecedented luminosity with an absolute UV magnitude M = -22.5 (AB), significantly brighter than other GRB hosts at comparable redshift (e.g., Hjorth et al. 2012, ApJ, 756, 187; Sears et al. 2024, ApJ, 966:133). However, this interpretation would be consistent with a mild break in the continuum blueward of the line, which could be the onset of the Lyman forest, as well as with the red color of the VT afterglow (VT R-B = 1.45 +/- 0.20 mag: Qiu et al., GCN 38516).

The observation was carried out with mid-time 06:35:08 UT on 2024 December 29 (~1.1 days after the trigger).

In the image taken with the acquisition camera, we detect the proposed optical afterglow (Kumar et al., GCN 38684 and GCN 38691; An et al.

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we clearly detect a continuum over the entire wavelength range. From the detection of a broad Lya absorption at ~4470 AA and multiple absorption features, which interpreted as being due to NV, SII, SiII, OI, CII, SiIV, CIV, FeII, AlII, AlIII, NiII, CrII, ZnII, MgII, MgI, SiII*, OI*, CII*, FeII*, NiII*, we infer a common redshift of z = 2.674. The detection of fine-structure lines confirms the afterglow nature of the source, and we conclude this is the redshift of the burst. A strong Lyman alpha emission line is detected at a consistent redshift, which we interpret as being due to the GRB host galaxy.

We also note the presence of additional absorption features likely due to multiple intervening systems at z = 2.000 and z = 1.824.

We have analyzed 13 ks of Swift XRT data of GRB 050824
(Campana et al., GCN3866).

The 0.2-10 keV light curve XRT (started 6089 seconds after the BAT
trigger) now shows an indication of a temporal decay with a power
law index of -0.4+/-0.2 (90% confidence level).
The power law fit is better than a constant fit at a 3.3 sigma
level (F-test). This indicates that the source suggested in the
previous XRT circular (Campana et al., GCN3872) is the X-ray
afterglow of GRB050824.

The 307 photons in the 0.3-10 keV evergy band were also used for
spectral analysis. We fixed the column density to the Galactic value
(3.6x10^20 cm-2) and added a free local absorption at z=0.83 (Fynbo

The observation was conducted using the GMG-2.4m telescope with Grism #14, which provides a wavelength coverage of 3600–7460 AA. A single 1800s spectrum was obtained, with exposure beginning at 14:24:54.5 UT on 2025-01-01, about 1.03 hours after the Swift trigger.

The Ly-alpha absorption feature at ~ 4250 AA is evident. Despite the low signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, we identified multiple metal absorption lines: Si II at 1303 AA, C II at 1335 AA, Si IV at 1394 AA, Si IV at 1403 AA, C IV at 1549 AA, Al II at 1671 AA, Al III at 1855 AA, and Al III at 1863 AA. These metal absorption features consistently indicate a redshift of z ~ 2.481, which is consistent with the Xinglong-2.16m result (Zhu et al., GCN 38759).

Although the planned observation was longer, weather and technical issues prevented us from completing the planned observation.

In a preliminary reduction, the spectrum shows a red trace with strong features that we identify as being due to the Lyman-alpha forest, a broad damped Lyman-alpha feature, and strong lines of SiII, SiII*, SiIV, OI, CII, CIV, amongst others, at a common redshift of 4.01. Further analysis is ongoing.

The underlying galaxy mentioned by Xu et al. (GCN 38808) has AB magnitudes in the Legacy survey of g=24.55, r=23.16, i=22.77, z=22.52. We note that this photometry does show a break in the g-band, which would be consistent with the Lyman break at z = 4.

Following the detection of the optical afterglow (Rastinejad et al., GCN 38855) of GRB 250108B  (Klinger et al., GCN 38847), we obtained optical spectroscopy using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS-N) mounted on Gemini-North, under Program GN-2024B-Q-107 (P.I. Rastinejad). The mean time of the observation was 15:12 UT on 2025 Jan 8 (4.81 hr post-burst). The total exposure time was 4x400 s using the R400 grating, which covers the wavelength range 4650-9450 AA.

Given the faintness of the target (r ~ 23.4; Rastinejad et al., GCN 38855), only a weak trace is detected, with most of the signal apparent at the red end of the spectrum. A few absorption features are weakly detected. A possible redshift solution, based on the detection of Mg I 2852, Mg II 2796,2803, Fe II 2600, and Fe II 2586, yields z = 2.197, which we suggest to be the redshift of GRB 250108B.

The slit was aligned in order to cover also the nearby galaxy (Rastinejad et al., GCN 38855) at coordinates RA = 13:25:18.72, Dec = +25:37:12.7, with photometric redshift z = 0.2-0.3, resulting in a bright trace. We detect Halpha, [N II], and [S II] at z = 0.302, consistent with the Legacy Survey photometric redshift of z = 0.29 +/- 0.04 (Zhou et al., 2021).

and 7.4 hours after the burst, we measure the temporal index to be -1.20.
At 7.4 hours after the burst, we measure J - K = 1.2 mag, corresponding to
a spectral index of -0.35.

Scaling the i and R limits of Fox et al. (GCN 3912) to 3.0 hours after the
burst, we measure i - J > 1.85 mag and R - J > 3.05 mag, corresponding to
spectral indexes of <-1.90 and <-3.35, respectively.

This is too steep to be explained by even heavy extinction.  If
interpretted as dropout, this corresponds to 5.3 < z < 9.0 (calculated
using filter centers).

The optical counterpart is well detected in the acquisition obtained at 23:10:36 UT (mean epoch 1.7661 hrs after the burst) with an r-band AB magnitude of 21.78 +/- 0.06 mag, as compared with 4 field stars from the Sloan catalogue.

The spectra show a faint trace with clear absorption features. In a preliminary reduction, we identify features of Ly-alpha, SII, SiII, SiII*, OI, CII, SiIV, CIV, FeII, FeII* at a common redshift of 3.55, which we identify as the redshift of the GRB.

GCN 39413) of GRB 250221A (Caputo et al., GCN 39396) using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA, and consist of 4x600 s exposures. The slit’s position angle was set to cover the afterglow position as well as the nearby object to the NW (Watson et al., GCN 39397; Cotter et al. GCN 39413). The observation mid time was 2025 Feb 22.08 UT (~22.5 hr after the GRB).

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we detect two blended traces, corresponding to the afterglow and to the NW object. Spatially consistent with the afterglow position, we detect emission lines of  H alpha, [O III] 5007, [O III] 4959, H beta, [O II] 3726/3729 at a common redshift of z = 0.768.

In the UBV arm, the trace is dominated by the afterglow continuum. Absorption features are detected corresponding to Mg II and Fe II, at a consistent redshift, which we suggest is the redshift of the burst.

We should note the presence of a possible, weak emission feature at 16,855 AA at the position of the afterglow trace. We are not able to identify this feature presently and a full reduction of the data is required to ascertain its reality.

At the position of the NW object, a faint, red continuum is detected in the VIS and NIR arms. No clear emission or absorption features are detected, and at the moment we can not provide a redshift determination for this object.

We thank Alan Watson (UNAM) for providing us with accurate coordinates of the afterglow. We acknowledge expert support from the ESO staff in Paranal, in particular Francesca Lucertini and Rodrigo Palominos.

We observed the near-infrared candidate counterpart (Malesani et al., GCN 39727) of the long SVOM/ECLAIRs GRB 250314A (Wang et al., GCN 39719) at the ESO VLT, using the HAWK-I near-infrared imager (on UT4, Kueyen) and the X-shooter spectrograph (on UT3, Melipal).

The object is well detected in the Y, J and H filters. HAWK-I observations started on 2025 Mar 15 at 05:23:28 UT (about 16.5 hr after the GRB). We measure preliminary AB magnitudes:

Y = 23.2 +/- 0.15
J = 22.4 +/- 0.1
H = 22.5 +/- 0.1

For the spectra, the observation mid time was 2025 Mar 15.26 UT (about 17.4 hr after the GRB). The data cover the wavelength range 3000-21,000 AA and consist of 4 exposures of 1200 s each.

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, a faint continuum is confidently detected all across the NIR arm (down to 10,300 AA). Tentative signal is also seen in the very red end of the VIS arm, with a drop around 10,090 AA. While the S/N is too low to confidently identify individual metal absorption features, the break in the VIS is consistent with the onset of the Lyman forest (with possible contribution from damped Lyman-alpha absorption in the GRB host galaxy). The implied redshift is z ~ 7.3.

The HAWK-I photometry is consistent with a break, rather than with a generically red shape of the continuum, given the red Y-J vs blue J-H color, consistent with the Y filter being partly dropped out. Assuming a power law model (no dust extinction), a fit to the available photometry provides a redshift z = 7.21 +0.18 -0.38 (1 sigma c.l.), fully consistent with the spectroscopic value.

Adding our z-band limit to the nearly simultaneous YJH photometry provided by VLT/HAWK-I (Malesani et al., GCN 39732) allows us to derive a more refined photometric redshift of z = 7.27 +0.14 -0.19 (1 sigma c.l.), assuming a power-law afterglow model with no dust extinction.

The spectrum shows continuum above 4000 AA, with features consistent with at least two low-column density Lyman systems at redshifts of z=3.442 and 3.447 (or a dynamic separation of 1500 km/s), likely corresponding to the same galaxy or system.

We obtained 4x900-sec exposures using the R400 grating, spanning approximately 5000A to 9500A, starting at 2025-03-23 05:33:34 UT (approx 13.5 hr post-burst), under Program GN-2025A-Q-114 (PI: Fong). 

The continuum is well-detected along with several prominent emission lines. In particular, we identify emission lines of H-alpha, NII, OIII (5007), H-beta and H-gamma, corresponding to a common redshift of z=0.42.

We observed the bright galaxy within the localization of GRB 250322A (Gupta et al., GCN 39835, Goad et al. GCN 39841, Martin-Carillo et al.

Observations began at T+32.2 hours and obtained a total of 2x600s spectra at an average airmass of about 1.2 and seeing of 0.6”. 

We detect a bright continuum in the VIS and NIR arms and identify multiple emission lines, including H_alpha, H_beta, NII, OII, SII, at a common redshift of 0.4215±0.0005, consistent with measurement by Fong et al. (GCN 39852). We estimated that the chance coincidence between the bright galaxy and the XRT localization is <2% (Bloom et al. 2002), supporting it as a likely host galaxy of the GRB.

In a 10-s r-band exposure taken with the acquisition camera (1.58 hr after the SVOM trigger), a source is well detected at the location of the counterpart reported by Watson et al., GCN 39915 with a magnitude r = 21.9 +/- 0.1 (AB, calibrated against a single Pan-STARRS object). Our measurement is consistent with Wang et al. GCN 39917 and confirms the fast fading nature of this source and its likely association with GRB 250329A.

Our spectra, covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA, consist of 4 exposures of 600 s each. The observation mid time was on 2025 Mar 29.2611 UT (1.97 hr after the SVOM trigger). In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, a break is visible at ~4775 AA, which we identify as due to HI Lyman-alpha absorption.

Due to its spatial coincidence, this is the likely GRB host galaxy.

We obtained two spectra of 1000 s each with the X-shooter instrument, starting at 07:08:05 UT on 2025 April 3, i.e. about 36.5 days after the Swift trigger. The observations were obtained under good conditions, with a measured seeing of 0.5"".

Emission lines are detected in the visible and near-infrared arms, which we identify as H-alpha, [O III] 5007 and the [O II] 3726,3729 doublet at a common redshift of z = 0.950. This value is consistent with the photometric solution z_phot = 1.12 +/- 0.18 from the Legacy Survey (Zhou et al. 2021, doi:10.1093/mnras/staa3764). The absolute magnitude of the galaxy is M_B ~ -21, which is at the bright end of the distribution of long-duration (collapsar) GRB hosts. Our redshift measurement rules out an association between the object in the Legacy Survey and ESO 340-26 at z = 0.018. Considering the low chance association probability (Schneider et al., GCN 39494; Yang et al., GCN 39495), we consider this to be the likely redshift of GRB 250225B.

GRB 250404A / EP250404a was detected by Fermi GBM (Fermi GBM team, GCN 40050) and by EP/WXT (Hu et al., GCN 40051).

The spectroscopic observation was conducted using the GMG-2.4m telescope with Grism #14, which provides a wavelength coverage of 3600–7460 AA. A single 1800s spectrum was obtained, with exposure beginning at 2025-04-04T15:18:24, about 0.98 hours after the Fermi/GBM and EP/WXT trigger (Fermi GBM team, GCN 40050; Hu et al., GCN 40051).

Two absorption systems were identified in the spectrum. 

For the first absorption system, we detected multiple metal absorption features, including Si II at 1527 AA, Al II at 1671 AA, Al III at 1855 AA and 1863 AA, Zn II/Cr II at 2026 AA and 2062 AA, and Fe II at 2344 AA, 2374 AA, and 2383 AA. These features consistently indicate a redshift of z ~ 1.881. 

For the second absorption system, the spectrum shows multiple metal absorption lines from Si II/S II at 1260 AA, O I/Si II at 1303 AA, C II at 1335 AA, Si IV at 1394 AA, Si II at 1527 AA, Fe II at 1608 AA, and Al III at 1863 AA. These absorption features correspond to a redshift of z ~ 2.627. 

These results support a redshift of z ~ 2.627 for the transient, consistent with the measurement reported by Xinglong-2.16m (Zhu et al., GCN 40061).

The 300V grism with no order-blocking filter was adopted, covering the wavelength range 3300-9600 AA (with potential second-order contamination redward of 6600 AA). Observations started on 2025 April 4 at 02:15:01 UT (10.99 hr after the burst). Two exposures of 600 s each were obtained.

From a 60 s acquisition image obtained on 2025 April 4 at 02:01:37 UT (10.76 hr after the burst), we measure R ~ 21.1 +/- 0.2 mag (AB) calibrated against nearby Pan-STARRS objects.

From a preliminary reduction of the spectrum, continuum is detected over the wavelength range 3600-9600 AA. While the spectrum is noisy blueward of 3720 AA, we can set an upper limit to the redshift z < 2.06 due to the lack of Lyman forest. Four clear absorption features are apparent in clean regions of the spectrum, three of which match Si IV 1393, Si IV 1402 and the (blended) C IV doublet 1548,1550 at a common redshift z = 1.847. The fourth line seems marginally split and could be an intervening C IV doublet at z = 1.763, although no other features are seen to confirm this value.

The observed absorption system is somewhat peculiar (but not unprecedented), as some typically strong low-ionization features common in long GRB spectra (de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2012, doi:10.1051/0004-6361/201219894) are either non-detected or only marginally detected. This indicates a high-ionization environment, which has been previously linked to systems with low H I column density (e.g. Jakobsson et al. 2006, doi:10.1051/0004-6361:20066405; Thoene et al. 2011, doi:10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18408.x; Vielfaure et al. 2020, doi:10.1051/0004-6361/202038316).

At a consistent location, the Legacy Survey also reveals a source, the likely GRB host galaxy, with a somehow fainter magnitude r = 22.65.

Observations started on 2025-04-17 at 07:44:43 (i.e., ~0.58 days after the EP detection), and consisted of 4 exposures of 900 s each using the B480 grating, covering the wavelength range between ~4000 and 9500 AA.

In our spectrum, we clearly detect an emission line at 7317 AA. Considering the most likely options for this feature (Halpha, Hbeta, [O III], [O II]), the interpretation more consistent with the data is the (unresolved) [O II] 3727/3729 doublet at z = 0.963. In all other cases, we would expect to see other features which would fall over well-covered regions of the spectrum, which are not observed. We thus suggest that this is the redshift of the host galaxy of EP250416a.

The spectrum shows tentative absorption features at the expected locations of Mg II (2796, 2803 AA) and Mg I (2852 AA) at z = 0.962, although the signal to noise in the blue region of the spectrum is badly affected by the bright Moon, hence we cannot conclusively determine an absorption redshift.

We acknowledge excellent support from the Gemini South staff.

In the acquisition image (taken at a mid time of 0.851 hr after the Swift/BAT trigger), the counterpart is well detected with a magnitude r = 19.09 +- 0.02, calibrated against nearby stars from the SkyMapper catalog (Wolf et al. 2018, doi:10.4225/41/593620ad5b574).

We detect a bright continuum over the wavelength range 3100 to 24,500 AA. Many absorption features are visible which we interpret as Mn II, Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, Ti II, Ca II, Na I, including a number of fine-structure transitions from Fe II*, all at a common redshift z = 0.310. At a consistent redshift, we also detect several emission lines, due to [O II], [O III], [S II], [N II], and the Balmer lines from the GRB host galaxy (Perez-Fournon et al., GCN 40227).

Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-21,000 AA, and consist of 2 exposures of 600 s each. The observation mid time was 2025 Apr 27.394 UT (5.80 hr after the GRB).

In a 30-s image taken in the r band at a mid time of 5.61 hr after the trigger, we measure a magnitude r = 18.40 +- 0.02 AB, calibrated against nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog.

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we clearly observe a bright continuum over the entire covered wavelength range, detected at high S/N. The sightline is rich with intervening absorption systems, in particular C IV absorbers (1548,1550 doublet) are detected at z = 1.146, 1.222, 1.231, 1.405, 1.407, 1.518, and 1.520.

The highest-redshift system is only securely detected in C IV and Si IV (at both z = 1.518 and 1.520). There is a possible indication of Lyman alpha absorption at the very blue end of the spectrum, with very low column density (much less than a DLA). The system at z = 1.405/1.407 is on the other hand the strongest and has detection in many species at both high and low ionization, including Si II, C II, Si IV, C IV, Fe II, Al II, Al III, Mg II and Mg I, as well as a rich velocity structure. No emission lines are visible at any of the above mentioned redshifts.

Our data are therefore in good agreement with the results and the redshift value z = 1.520 already reported by Chornock et al. (GCN 40265) using the Keck telescope.

In a 3x30-s image, taken in the r band at a mid time of 10.34 hr after the trigger, the optical counterpart is detected at RA, Dec 233.3872, -18.1184 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000) = 15:33:32.93
Dec (J2000) = -18:07:06.3

These coordinates are in good agreement with those reported by Odeh et al. (GCN 40295). We measure a preliminary AB magnitude r = 21.97 +/- 0.06, calibrated against nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog.

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we observe a continuum over the entire covered wavelength range, fainter in the UVB and VIS arms than in the NIR. A few absorption features are detected, which we interpret as the Mg II doublet (2796, 2804) and Fe II (2374, 2383, 2587, 2600), all at the common redshift z = 0.767. No emission lines are observed across the whole covered spectrum.

We note the presence of a catalogued object in the Legacy Survey DR10 at a position consistent with the optical afterglow. The magnitudes of the galaxy are g = 24.59 +/- 0.25, r = 23.22 +/- 0.10, i = 21.96 +/- 0.05, and z = 21.35 +/- 0.04, and its centroid is 0.5"" away from the optical afterglow position. Our spectroscopic redshift measurement is consistent with the photometric redshift value provided of 0.89 +/- 0.11. This object is the likely host galaxy of GRB 250430A, though we notice that its red colors and lack of emission lines are not typical of a long (collapsar) GRB host.

Moss et al., GCN 40356;
EP-WXT detection: Wang et al., GCN 40299)
was detected by Konus-Wind (KW) in the waiting mode.

A Bayesian block analysis of the KW waiting mode data in the 20-400 keV band 
reveals a ~16 sigma count-rate increase in the interval
from T0-0.581 s to T0+5.307 s, where T0 = T0(BAT) = 17:31:00.28 UT.

The KW light curve of this burst is available
at http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB250430A/

To derive broad-band spectral parameters of this burst,
we performed a joint spectral analysis of the Swift/BAT data
(15-150 keV) and the KW 3-channel spectral data (20-1600 keV).

A fit to the time-averaged spectrum, measured from T0-0.581 s
to T0+5.307 s, by the Band GRB function results in
alpha = -0.99(-0.31,+0.70),
beta = -2.01(-0.39,+0.19), and
Ep = 107(-44,+86) keV (chi2/dof= 57.7/59).

The total burst fluence is 3.21(-0.92,+1.09)x10^-6 erg/cm^2,
and the 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0+0.446 s,
is 1.63(-0.50,+0.58)x10^-6 erg/cm^2.
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

Assuming the redshift z=0.767 (Garnichey et al., GCN 40301)
and a standard cosmology with H_0 = 67.3 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.315,
and Omega_Lambda = 0.685 (Planck Collaboration, 2014),
we estimate the burst isotropic energy release
E_iso to 5.26(-1.50,+1.78)x10^51 erg,
the isotropic peak luminosity L_iso to 2.35(-0.72,+0.84)x10^51 erg/s,
and the rest-frame peak spectral energy Ep,z to 189(-77,+151) keV.

With the obtained estimates, GRB 250430A is inside 68% prediction bands for both 
the 'Amati' and the 'Yonetoku' relations derived for the sample of >300 long KW GRBs

al., GCN 4020, Rykoff et al. GCN 4011) using UVES at VLT/Kueyen.  The
observations consisted of 2 exposures for a total of 6000 seconds net
integration covering the full spectral range 3100-10000 Angstrom, under 
good seeing conditions. At the time of the observations the afterglow
magnitude was R~19-19.5. The resulting continuum signal to noise per
resolution element spans from 10 to 20 in the 4000-7000 Angstrom
range. The afterglow is clearly detected down to ~3300 Angstrom.
A preliminary analysis of the data shows a very rich spectrum.  We
find four main systems at z=2.199, 2.077, 2.008 and 1.9985 (the first
2 systems have been previously reported by Jakobsson et al., GCN

We carried out spectroscopic observations of AT2025mgj (Andreoni et al., GCN 40566), a candidate optical counterpart to GRB 250521C (Fermi GBM team, GCN 40515), using the ALFOSC camera mounted on the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). We obtained 4x900 s exposures starting at 21:16 UT on 2025-05-31 (10.3 days after the Fermi trigger) with a wavelength coverage of 3800-9500 AA. 

The spectrum shows a blue, featureless continuum, peaking at around 4500 AA. Redward of the peak, the continuum is consistent with a power law F_lambda propto lambda^-2.7. The overall shape does not resemble a power-law spectrum, which would be typical of GRB afterglows, nor a SN spectrum, given the lack of any features. Although the spectrum does not fully resemble those of dwarf novae in outbursts, the spectral energy distribution is overall consistent with previous examples (e.g. Aviles et al. 2018, doi:10.14482/INDES.30.1.303.661).

In summary, our spectroscopic observations confirm that AT2025mgj is not associated with GRB250521C, as already suggested by Busmann et al. (GCN 40597) and Gillanders et al. (GCN 40605) based on photometric observations.",No Redshift,GRB 250521C,Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT),Spectroscopic

report:


We have finally analysed the I-band images of the error box of GRB
051008 obtained with the Tautenburg Schmidt telescope. Photometric
calibration was performed using the USNO-B1.0 catalog (Monet et al.
2003).

Two sets of images were taken. The first one consists of six 20 sec
frames (mean time 1.00 hrs after the burst), the second set consists
of six 120 sec frames (mean time 1.25 hrs after the burst). We do not
detect any souce in the XRT error circle (Perri et al., GCN 4073) down
to about I=18.0 and I=18.8, respectively.

Given these I-band upper limits and the deep R upper limit reported by 
Rumyantsev et al. (GCN 4081), the afterglow of GRB 051008 is another
example for the general faintness of Swift afterglows compared to
those discovered prior to Swift (cf. Berger et al. 2005, ApJ 629,
328). According to our data archive (Kann et al. 2006, in preparation), there 
are 20 afterglows with reliable I-band data
(known light curve parameters alpha_1, alpha_2, and t_break) so that
one can at least extrapolate the light curve to a time period of 1 hr
after the corresponding burst. Among these 20 afterglows at least 18
were brighter than the one of GRB 051008, after correction
for Galactic extinction (GRB 051008 has E(B-V) = 0.01 mag; Schlegel
et al. 1998, ApJ 500, 525).

We note that the very early break time of 0.19 days found in  the
X-ray light curve (Perri et al. 2005, GCN 4080) favors a relatively
near-by event when compared with the afterglow sample in the pre-Swift
era. Assuming that this is a jet break, it is earlier than most of
the bursts in the sample of  Zeh et al. (2005, astro-ph/0509299). To
equal the earliest jet break in the Zeh et al. sample (GRB  041006:
t_break = 0.14 days in the host frame), the redshift of GRB 051008
must be z < 0.36.

On the other hand, if we use the burst data (fluence & peak energy from 
Golenetskii et al., jet break time from Perri et al.) to place the GRB on the 
Ghirlanda relation (Ghirlanda et al. 2004, ApJ, 616, 331) using the fit from 
Zeh et al. and the typical density parameter n=10 cm^-3 of Friedman & Bloom 
2005 (ApJ, 627, 1), low redshifts are highly disfavored, as the high peak 
energy is in contrast with the early break and thus a large collimation 
correction. A redshift around one is favored.

If the burst was near-by, which could also be indicated by its
high gamma-ray flux and fluence (Golenetskii et al. 2005, GCN 4078),
given the deduced NH column density (Perri et al. 2005, GCN 4080)
host extinction alone cannot explain the faintness of the afterglow
for a gas-to-dust ratio that is close to that of the SMC.
This implies a relatively low-luminosity afterglow. It also implies
the possible appearance of a detectable supernova component
with a peak magnitude brighter than R=21.9 (assuming a SN 1998bw
event).

report:

We have performed a spectral analysis of the WXM and FREGATE spectral
data for GRB 051022.  Fitting a power-law times exponential (PLE) model
jointly to the WXM and FREGATE spectral data yields a chi^2 of 185 for
139 DOF, while fitting a PLE model with absorption yields a chi^2 of
131 for 138 DOF.  Fitting a Band model jointly to the WXM and FREGATE
spectral data also yields a chi^2 of 131 for 138 DOF.  These results
show that the data strongly favor a PLE model with absorption over a
PLE model alone, and that a PLE model with absorption gives a 
satisfactory fit to the data.  They also show that the data do not 
request a Band model with absorption.

The best-fit spectral parameters for the PLE model with absorption are
alpha = -1.22+/-0.02, E_peak = 306 + 31/-26 keV, and n_H = 1.7  0.4

We have performed spectral and temporal analyses of the first three 
Swift XRT ToO follow-up observations of the HETE-2--localized burst 
GRB 051022 (Olive et al., GCN 4131; Tanaka et al. 4137; Doty et al. 
4145). Localization of the X-ray afterglow of the burst was reported 
by Racusin et al. (GCN 4141) based on the first two orbits of XRT 
data. The PC mode data that we have analyzed have an effective 
exposure of 14.2 ksec for the time period of 12.5 to 182.3 ksec after 
the burst. Modeling the count rate decay in the 0.5-10 keV band as a 
power-law in time, the best-fit decay index is alpha = 1.33 +/- 0.07. 
There is no evidence for a jet break in the XRT data that we have 
analyzed.  The 0.2-10 keV spectrum is well-fit (Chi2/nu = 189/172) by 
a power-law model with absorption.  We find n_H = (0.84 +/- 0.07) x 
10^22 cm^-2, roughly consistent with the value derived from the 
HETE-2 WXM and FREGATE data (Doty et al., GCN 4145) and greater than 
the Galactic value in the direction of the burst at the 30-sigma 
significance level, using the Likelihood Ratio test (Delta Chi2 = 890 
for one additional degree freedom).  The photon index is gamma = 2.0 
+/- 0.1 and the mean unabsorbed flux is (1.9 +/- 0.1) x 10^-11 erg 
cm^-2 s^-1.  The spectral parameters do not appear to evolve in time 
during the observation.

In our calculation (Butler et al. GCN 4165) of the extinction of the 
optical and NIR afterglow of GRB 051022 in the observer frame implied 
by the best-fit value of the absorption of the X-ray afterglow 
measured by the Swift XRT, we did not take into account the 
transformation between the absorption of the X-ray spectrum as 
measured in the observer frame and that measured in the rest frame of 
the host galaxy. Taking this transformation into account, and using 
the same method as that described in Butler et al. (GCN 4165), we

The error box is consistent with a source in M81.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst had a duration of 0.17 sec,
fluence 2.34(-0.28, +0.31)10^-5 erg/cm2,
and peak flux on 2ms time scale 1.89 (-0.35, +0.25)10^-3 erg/cm2/sec
(both in 20 keV - 10 MeV range).
The Epeak of the time-integrated spectrum is 1920 +/- 400 keV.
Assuming this burst originated from a source in M81 (D = 4 Mpc),
the isotrpoic energy release of this GRB is ~4.5x10^46 erg,
which consistent with the energy release of
27 December giant flare from SGR 1806-20.

The peak flux of this GRB is the largest ever observed for
the Konus-Wind short GRBs.

""We have further analyzed the Keck/HIRES spectrum of GRB 051111.
A total integration of 5400s was acquired covering 4200-8400Ang
with a SNR~20 per 1.3km/s pixel at 5500Ang.  The main component
is ~30km/s wide, contains 90% of the gas and is centered at
z=1.54948 +/- 0.00001.  The full line-profile, however, spans
~250km/s.

The gas in the GRB host is remarkable for several reasons:
(1) The SiII 1808 and ZnII 2026, 2062 transitions are saturated
implying log N(Zn) > 13.5 and log N(Si) > 15.9.  We believe these are
the largest Zn and Si column densities recorded outside the Local Group;
(2) The observed Zn/Fe ratio is [Zn/Fe] > 1.2 indicating significant
differential depletion;  (3) We detect the fine-structure SiII* 1816
transition and observe that the weak MgI 2026 transition is saturated.
(4) Perhaps more stunning, we detect nearly every FeII excited  
transition
in the Morton catalog redward of 2300Ang.  This includes several
transitions from the 977K excited level.  These suggest both a large
volume density and a warm gas.

We place a lower limit to N(HI) assuming a solar metallicity for
the gas: log N(HI) > 20.8.  The high metal column density and
significant differential depletion imply a rest-frame V-band
extinction A(V) > 0.5mag.  Adopting the Milky Way extinction curve,
this implies an observed R-band extinction A(R_obs) > 1.4mag.
The extinction is several times larger if one adopts the SMC or
Calzetti curves.

We also identify a very strong intervening MgII system at z=1.18975.

of spectral lags in short bursts (Norris & Bonnell, submitted to ApJ).

report:

The HETE FREGATE instrument detected the initial peak of GRB 051227
(Swift Trigger 174738; Barbier, et al., GCN 4397) as an untriggered
event.

Carrying out a fit to the FREGATE spectral data alone, the spectrum 
of the initial peak is adequately fit by a power-law (PL) model, with
photon index alpha = 1.3 +0.4/-0.6 (90% confidence level).  This
confirms the result reported by Hullinger et. al (GCN 4400).

Carrying out a joint fit to the BAT plus FREGATE spectral data, the
best-fit cutoff PL model yields an improvement in ch^i2 over the
best-fit PL model of 5.2 for one additional parameter, corresponding 
to a significance of 2.3E-02.  Thus the joint spectral fit provides
evidence of curvature in the spectrum.

Adopting the best-fit cutoff PL model yields a best-fit value of 
Epk = 100 +219/-41.3 keV (90% confidence level) and a fluence ratio 
S(2 keV-30 keV)/S(30 keV-400 keV) = 0.19.  The event is therefore a 
hard GRB.",No Redshift,GRB 051227,HETE,Spectroscopic

The near-infrared counterpart (Kocevski, Bloom & McGrath, GCNs 4528, 
4540) of GRB 060116 (Campana et al., GCN 4519; Barthelmy et al., GCN 
4531) was observed again with the ESO VLT, adopting the FORS1 and ISAAC 
instruments. Observations were clustered around 2005 Jan 18.1 UT.

The afterglow is clearly detected in the J, H and K filters, and is seen 
to decline achromatically in J and K, comparing our new measurements 
with those secured during the night of Jan 16 (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 
4532; Malesani et al., GCN 4541). The power law decay index is alpha ~ 1.

The object is also detected in the z band, but is not seen in the I and 
R filters.

By fitting the available photometry with a power law suppressed by 
neutral Hydrogen absorption, we measure a photometric redshift z = 6.7 
and z = 6.6 for the first and second night, respectively. Combining 
together the two datasets, we get z = 6.60, the 1-sigma confidence 
interval being 6.45 < z < 6.75. The observed NIR spectral index 
(rest-frame UV) is quite steep, indicating
significant extinction in the rest frame.

GRB 060116 may thus be the farthest observed GRB, and rank among the 
most distant objects detected to date in the Universe.

We would like to acknowledge the painstaking work of the ESO staff to 
perform our service-mode observations. In particular, the ISAAC NIR

report:

A preliminary analysis of the WXM and FREGATE spectral data for GRB
060121 (=H4010) shows that the data is adequately fit by a power-law
times exponential model with best-fit parameters 

alpha = -0.46 +/- 0.07
E_peak = 120 +/- 7 keV.

Thus the spectrum of the burst is very hard, as expected for a 
short/hard GRB.

The preliminary spectral analysis gives fluences for the burst of 0.66
x 10-6 erg cm-2 in the 2-30 keV energy band, 4.3 x 10-6 erg cm-2 in the
30-400 keV energy band, and 4.9 x 10-6 erg cm-2 in the 2-400 keV energy
band.  The burst is thus quite bright, given that its T90 duration is
about 2 seconds.

GCN 4519, 4522; Kocevski et al., GCN 4528, 4540).

We compared the available photometry with a power law afterglow, 
including rest frame dust extinction. The chi square versus z curve 
presents two minima. The lowest chi square corresponds to the solution 
with z~6.6 and little rest-frame extinction as reported in GCN 4545. The 
other minimum corresponds to a solution with z=3.8-4.5 (1 sigma 
confidence level) and E(B-V)~0.5.

On 2005 January 19, starting at 01:19 UT (about 2.7 days after the GRB), 
we  obtained low resolution spectra of the afterglow of GRB 060116 
(Kocevski et al. GCNs 4528, 4540) using VLT+FORS2. The observation 
consisted of 10 exposures of 1800 seconds each using the grism 300I with 
a 1"" slit under good seeing conditions.  A very faint object, close to 
the detection limit, is visible at the afterglow position in the 
combined spectrum. Its spectrum may extend down to about 7000 Angstrom 
blueward. This would be consistent with the lower redshift reported 
above. However, the statistics is very poor and a robust conclusion can 
not be drawn at this time. Further analysis is in progress.

We acknowledge the efficient support of the ESO staff at Paranal.

identify an absorption line at ~4000Ang consistent with
Lya absorption and indicating log N(HI) < 20.5.

Although we may also detect a weak feature consistent with

for exhibiting very weak low-ion features (e.g. non-detections

In this respect the spectrum is similar to the afterglows
of GRB 050908 and GRB 021004.

giving an effective wavelength coverage of ~6250 - 9050 Ang.  A
previously-measured instrument response function was used for an
approximate flux calibration.

Interestingly, the spectrum appears very blue, in contrast with
theoretical expectations for an afterglow.  Though the spectrograph slit
was aligned close to the parallactic angle, the observations were
performed at an airmass of ~3.6 and with a bright dawn sky foreground.  
However, we do not think that the observed spectral slope can be entirely
explained by the differential slit losses.  The extreme blueness is so
puzzling that we strongly encourage multiband photometric or additional
spectrophotometric observations to check this potentially interesting
result.

report:

The main peak of GRB 060124 (SWIFT trigger 178750, Fenimore et al. 
GCN 4586) triggered the FREGATE instrument on HETE at 16:04:09.5 UTC
(57849.5 SOD) on 24 January 2006 (HETE trigger 4012).  This time is 
557.7 s after the Swift trigger time.  The burst occurred at an angle
of about 60 degrees from the HETE boresight.  The main peak is the only
peak of this long GRB that was sufficiently bright to be seen by the
FREGATE instrument despite the large angle between the direction of the
source and the HETE boresight.

The burst locations provided by the Swift BAT and XRT instruments 
(Holland et al. GCN 4570, Fenimore et al. GCN 4586) are within the 
FREGATE FOV but outside the WXM FOV.  Consequently, we have FREGATE
data, but not WXM data, for this event.

The main peak is detected in FREGATE in the 7-40, 7-80, and 30-400 keV
bands.  It is highly structured in time, exhibiting two maxima at 13s
and 23s after the HETE trigger time.

The spectrum in the 7-400 keV energy band is best fit with a power-law
times exponential spectrum.  The best-fit values and the 90% confidence 
intervals for the low-energy photon number index alpha and Epk are

alpha: 1.17 (-0.27/+0.23)
Epk:   305 (-118/+756) keV.

These parameter estimates are consistent with the KONUS results
reported by Golenetskii et al. (GCN 4599).

The extrapolated fluence in the 2-30 keV energy band is 
(1.8  0.5) x 10-6 erg cm-2, the fluence in the 30-400 keV energy
band is (9.5  1) x 10-6 erg cm-2, and the extrapolated fluence in the 
2-400 keV energy band is (11  1) x 10-6 erg cm-2.  The ratio of the 
2-30 keV fluence and the 30-400 keV fluence is 0.19; therefore, the 
hardness of the main peak of GRB 060124 corresponds to that of a 
classical hard GRB.

the range 6400-9100 A and reveal one strong and resolved emission line at
an observed wavelength of 7826.0A, and a possible weaker line at 7590.8A.  
The latter line is located on the edge of the atmospheric A-band and and
its reality is therefore questionable.  We find three possible
interpretations for the redshift:

[1] The broad line is the (barely resolved) [OII] 3727 doublet at z=1.099.  
In this case there is no obvious interpretation for the second line.

[2] The broad line is H-alpha and the weak line line is [OI] 6364 at
z=0.193.  In this case we may expect to detect the [NII] and [SII]
doublets, which we do not.

[3] The broad line is [OIII] 5007 and the weak line is H-beta at z=0.562.  
In this case we expect to detect [OIII] 4959, which we do not.

Given that the weak line may not be real, and the lack of detection of
various other lines expected in scenarios [2] and [3], we favor the first
interpretation and a redshift z=1.099.

We note that spectra with bluer coverage may be able to confirm or rule
out options [2] and [3] through the detection (or lack thereof) of [OII],
[OIII], and H-beta at their corresponding redshifts.""",z=1.099,GRB 060123,Gemini-N 8-m telescope,Spectroscopic

the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS; Oke et al. 1995) on the
Keck II 10-m telescope of the transient associated with GRB 991208 (GCN
#450; GCN #451; GCN #452). The grating was 300 l/mm giving an effective
wavelength coverage of 3850 Ang to 8850 Ang with a dispersion of ~2.47
Ang/pixel. The optical transient is better detected in this spectrum
compared to the observations of December 14, 1999 and reported earlier
(GCN #460). Reductions of the December 15 data reveal an emission line at
lambda=8541 Ang (preliminary wavelength calibration). The presence of
continuum emission blueward of this line effectively rules out a Ly-alpha
origin.

The two most likely candidate identifications of this emission line are
[OII] 3727 Ang or H-alpha 6563 Ang.  If the former, then the redshift
implied, presumably that of the host galaxy, is z=1.29.  Coupled with the
bright fluence above 25 keV (10^-4 erg cm^-2; GCN #450) this implies an
isotropic emission (restframe 30-2000 keV) of ~4 x 10^{53} erg (Omega=0.2,
Lambda=0, H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc).  Such high energetics could be
relaxed by collimated emission as suggested by the steep decay in the
optical light curve.

If instead we associate the emission line with H-alpha 6563 Ang, then the
implied redshift is z=0.30, making it the lowest redshift of all
cosmological GRBs.  The associated isotropic energy loss would be ~2 x
10^{52} erg (Omega=0.2, Lambda=0, H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc), consistent with the
energies of GRB 970508, 970228, and GRB 980613.  We disfavor this
low-redshift hypothesis since the [OIII] 4959,5007 lines should be present
in our spectrum but we have not detected these lines. Nevertheless, if the
low redshift proves correct, then GRB 991208 would be an excellent
candidate for a detectable supernova component in the the coming month.""

We recalibrated and combined the Keck spectra of GRB 991208 obtained on
14 and 15 Dec 1999 UT, for which preliminary results were reported earlier 
(GCN #460, GCN #464).  Addition of the spectra improved the total S/N as
expected.  We confirm the existence of emission lines at the observed 
wavelengths 6356, 8454, and 8545 Ang, reported by Dodonov et al. (GCN #475).  
We agree with their proposed identifications as [O II] 3727, and [O III] 
4959, 5007, giving the redshift z = 0.7055 +- 0.0005.  However, we note 
that the proximity of the strong night sky lines (especially for the 
tentative 8454 Ang line), and additional spectroscopic observations are 
still needed in order to firm up this result.

Assuming z = 0.7055, and the standard Friedmann cosmology with h = 0.65,
Omega_0 = 0.2, and Lambda_0 = 0, the luminosity distance is 1.30E28 cm.
Assuming the integrated gamma-ray fluence of >~ 1.E-4 erg/cm2 (GCN #450), 
the implied isotropic energy is ~ 1.3E53 erg, which of course may be
affected by beaming.

We also performed a power-law fit to the fully calibrated and extinction
corrected spectrum from UT Dec. 15.64.  For F_nu ~ nu ** beta, we obtain 
beta = -0.9 +- 0.15, in a good agreement with the photometric measurement

inspection of the VLT-FORS2 spectrum of GRB060218/SN2006aj taken on 21 Feb 
2006 (Masetti et al. 2006, GCN 4803), i.e. ~3 days after the GRB event, 
indicates that the observed features are similar to those of the energetic 
type Ic SN 2002ap at a comparable epoch (Mazzali et al. 2002, Ap. J. 572, 
L21, Fig. 2). In particular, broad absorptions near 4800 Ang and 5800 Ang 
can be identified as due to FeII and SiII lines, respectively. This 
suggests that the SN and the GRB occurred within ~1 day of one another.

The observed luminosity of the optical counterpart of GRB060218 is larger 
than that of SN2002ap at the same epoch, and is consistent with the 
luminosity of SN1998bw.

If an afterglow is still present, we estimate that it does not contribute 
for more than 25% of the total flux. If it has a power-law shape, this is 
not bluer than nu^{-2}.

Although spectroscopy of SN1998bw did not begin until day 8 (Galama et al.

a bright short hard GRB at about 22:42:47 UT on March 3.
The burst was outside of the field of view of Swift-BAT, so it was not
imaged. Ulysses was off, and Odyssey did not observe this event.

We have derived a triangulation annulus centered at
RA(2000), Dec(2000) = 42.325 deg,  +16.869 deg,
whose radius is 73.266 0.173 deg (3 sigma).
Combining the all available data we have triangulated the GRB to
the section of this annulus between
RA(2000), Dec(2000)= 221, +26 and 230, +71 degrees.

As observed by Konus-Wind it had a duration of ~0.6 s,

report:


ESO's VLT-Kueyen (UT 2) observed SN 2006aj (GRB 060218) around the
time of maximum light on March 3/4, 2006. Observations were performed
using the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) at a
spectral resolution of 46 000. The signal-to-noise ratio of the
spectrum (2100 sec exposure time) is about 30 per resolution element,
which is sufficient to measure the equivalent width (EW) of the Na I D
lines along the line of sight.

For the Na I D2 component (lambda 5889.95) produced in our Galaxy we
find EW = (0.321 +/- 0.008) Angstrom. Using the empirical relation
between the equivalent width of the 5889.95 line and the interstellar
reddening (Munari & Zwitter A&A 318, 269, 1997), this corresponds to
a Galactic reddening of E(B-V) = (0.127 +/- 0.005) mag. Assuming a
ratio of total-to-selective extinction of R_V = 3.1, we obtain a
Galactic visual extinction along the line of sight of A_V = (0.39 +/-
0.02) mag. This is slightly less than what follows from the COBE
maps (Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis 1998).

In the GRB host galaxy we identify two redshift systems at a
heliocentric velocity of 10008.1 km/s and 10032.3 km/s (Na I D2) with
the following equivalent widths in the observer frame: system I:
EW(D2) = (0.084 +/- 0.008) Angstrom, system II: EW(D2) = (0.072 +/-
0.008) Angstrom. Assuming that the aforementioned empirical relation
is also representative for the interstellar medium in the GRB host
galaxy, and correcting EW for a factor of 1/(1+z) for the host frame, we
arrive at a combined reddening of E(B-V) = (0.042 +/- 0.003) mag. If
again R_V = 3.1, we obtain a host extinction along the line of sight
of A_V = (0.13 +/- 0.01) mag.

We finally note that the tiny error bars should not be overinterpreted.
They just include the measurement errors but not the systematic error
of the method itself, which we cannot quantify.

At Dec. 18.17 UT, we took two 30-minute low resolution spectra of the
optical counterpart to GRB991216 (GCN #472) with the VLT-Antu
telescope at the European Southern Observatory (ESO, Chile). These
spectra roughly cover the wavelength range 400-900nm.

We detect several absorption features that we can identify with the
following lines: FeII(at 237.45nm, 238.28nm, 258.67nm and 260.02nm),
MgII(279.64nm/280.35nm) and MgI(285.30nm), assuming there exist three
absorption systems at the redshifts z=0.77, z=0.80 and z=1.02.

No clear emission features are detected.

We are planning to take more spectra around Dec. 19.2 UT, which should
allow us to verify these preliminary results.

Spectra of the OT associated with GRB 991216 were obtained at the WMKO
Keck-II 10-m telescope by B. T. Soifer and D. J. Thompson on Dec. 18.3
UT, using LRIS instrument (Oke et al. 1995).  Grating with 150 l/mm
was used, giving the useful coverage of ~ 5600 - 10400 Ang, with a
mean dispersion of ~ 4.86 Ang/pixel.

Despite a strong continuum detection, no significant absorption or
emission features (other than atmospheric) have been detected in the
summed spectrum.  Absorbers at z ~< 1, as reported by Vreeswijk et
al. (GCN #496), would be outside the wavelength range of our data.

In addition, we measure R = 20.30 +/- 0.06 at Dec 18.40 UT from 5 150s
imaging exposures with LRIS.  The OT was calibrated against star ""B""
(Jha et al. GCN #476) with R=19.45 (Dolan et. al., GCN #486).  The
images were taken in 0.75"" seeing and the pixel scale is 0.21
arc-seconds/pixel. At this resolution, the PSF of the OT is consistent
that with neighboring stars, and we find no evidence for the excess
'fuzziness' reported by Schaefer (GCN #485).

No host galaxy is detected on the Digital POSS-II (DPOSS) scans,
corresponding to approximate limits of g > 21, r > 20.5, and i > 20 mag
(conservative limits) in the Gunn system.  This is consistent with the
absence of flattening of the light curve so far, and the lack of
detectable extension or PSF residuals in our Keck LRIS images.",No Redshift,GRB 991216,Keck-II 10-m telescope,Spectroscopic

flux level rises from ~150 uJy at 1.12 um to ~220 uJy at 1.23 um,
and remains approximately constant at ~220 uJy out to 1.33 um. 
It is thus not particularly well described by a single power law,

synchrotron emission, or that a break in the synchrotron spectrum was
near 1.25 microns at the time of observation.  The most obvious
alternative flux source is a host galaxy, although this host would

Mangano et al., GCN 5254; Brown et al., GCN 5262) with the ESO-VLT UT1

around Jun 15.416 and Jun 16.313 UT (0.88 and 1.78 days after the burst, 
respectively). Despite the bright, closeby Moon, both spectra have a 
good signal-to-noise ratio, and cover the wavelenght range 4500-9500 A.

We detect no significant features, neither in absorption nor in 
emission. On Jun 15.4, the continuum is well described by a power law 
with spectral index beta=0.60 (F_nu propto nu^-beta) in the range 
5000-9000 A (where the flux calibration is solid).

The lack of emission features may suggest that the host galaxy is 
relatively faint with respect to the afterglow (which had R~20.8 at the 
second epoch). For comparison, the spectra of the lowest-redshift GRBs 
(e.g. GRB 031203 and GRB 060218) revealed already in the earliest stages 
the nebular emission lines from the galaxy. Our observations, therefore, 
may imply a redshift larger than ~0.1.

We observed the afterglow of GRB 060614 (GCN #5254) with the Gemini
South telescope + GMOS.  Our observations consisted of 4x1800 sec
exposures with the R400 grating and 1 arcsec slit, commencing at June
19.3 UTC.  In each image we identify a single emission line at 7388A
superposed on a continuum emission with no apparent absorption
features.  If this line is due to [O II], the redshift is z = 0.98. 
However, there is a hint of a line at 5634A which suggests that the line
is actually due to Halpha at z = 0.13.

In addition to the bright emission line due to the GRB host galaxy,
there is a brighter emission line at the same wavelength from the galaxy
17 arcsec North of the GRB.  A spectrum from the Magellan telescope
reveals the presence of the [N II] doublet flanking the Halpha line for
this galaxy, with a secure redshift of z = 0.125.  Based on the
identical wavelength of the lines, the two galaxies are likely related,
at a redshift of z = 0.125; in this case, the separation in the plane of
the sky is 38 kpc.

Using the fluence of 2.17 x 10^-5 erg/cm^2 (GCN #5254), a redshift of z

On the night of 2006 July 25 (UT), we imaged the field of GRB051109B 
(GCN 4222) for 630 seconds in g' and 600 seconds in R using Keck I (+ 
LRIS).  There is a bright (R ~ 14.5) spiral galaxy close to the XRT 
position (GCN 4226), also visible in DSS and other surveys.  In our 
imaging, the galaxy is observed to be a barred spiral of type SBa.  The 
presence of a faint tidal bridge indicates that the galaxy has recently 
interacted with a neighboring galaxy 60"" to the north.

Using 25 X-ray sources and 51 DSS sources in the field, we calculate an 
improved XRT position of RA = 23:01:50.21, dec = +38:40:46.0 (with a 90% 
uncertainty radius of 2.2"", including an estimate of the systematic 
error.)  This position lies inside an outer spiral arm of the galaxy, 
identifying it as the GRB host.  In addition, both our position and the 
original XRT error circle include a faint optical point-like source at 
RA = 23:01:50.30, dec = +38:40:46.7 (0.5"" uncertainty).

We obtained spectroscopy of the host galaxy and optical source the 
following night.  The galaxy is observed to be at a redshift of z = 
0.080, and lacks any strong emission features.  Spectroscopy of the 
point source inside the XRT error circle shows no evidence for a 
nebular-phase supernova; however, there are emission lines indicating 
active star formation in this region.

The offset of the position of the optical source to the galaxy center is 
14.1"", or 20.9 kpc at the observed redshift.  This is the largest offset 
yet seen in a long GRB in angular or physical scale.  Using the 15-150 
keV gamma-ray fluence (GCN 4237), E_iso for this GRB is 4.1 x 10^48 
ergs, comparable to that observed for GRB980425 but less than that of 
any other GRB.  GRB980425/SN1998bw was also seen in a spiral galaxy at 
large offset, and also lacked a detected optical afterglow.

Given the low redshift of this system, inspection of archival images for 
the presence or absence of supernova emission is strongly encouraged. 
We also encourage radio and X-ray observations to look for a late-time 
afterglow or supernova.

features.  Identifying this line as [OII] at 3727A yields a redshift of
z = 1.131 for this galaxy. At this redshift, the observed fluence of 
8.1e-8 erg/cm2
(GCN 5381) corresponds to an isotropic-equivalent energy of 2.7e50 erg.

report:

We performed the Swift/BAT, Konus-Wind, and Suzaku/WAM joint fit spectral 
analysis of GRB 060813 (Swift-BAT trigger #224364; Moretti, et al., 
GCN Circ. 5442).  The time interval of the spectral data for each instrument 
is chosen as the same interval as the Konus-Wind time-averaged spectrum 
reported by Golenetskii et al. (GCN Circ. 5446).  The energy ranges which we 
used in the joint spectral analysis are 14-150 keV, 20-1000 keV, 
and 100-1000 keV, for Swift/BAT, Konus-Wind and Suzaku/WAM respectively.  
The spectral data of three instruments are fitted with the spectral model 
multiplied by the constant factor to take into account the systematic 
uncertainties in the response matrices of each instrument.  

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law time exponential cutoff model 
(dN/dE ~ E^{alpha} * exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak)).  The constant factors of each 
instrument agree within 10%.  No systematic residual from the best fit model 
is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  The best fit spectral 
parameters are: alpha = -0.83 +- 0.05 and Epeak = 240 (-10/+11) keV 
(chi2/dof = 135/125).  Although there is no significant improvement in the 
fit, the best fit parameters in the Band function are: the low-energy 
photon index alpha = -0.79 +- 0.06, the high energy photon index 
beta = -2.71 (-0.70/+0.24) and Epeak = 230 (-14/+15) keV 
(chi2/dof = 133/124).  The energy fluence in the 15-1000 keV band calculated 
by the Band function is 1.22 +- 0.05 x 10^-5 erg/cm2 (in case the constant 
factor of the Konus-Wind is fixed to 1).  The spectral paramters in a 
power-law time exponential cutoff model for Swift/BAT and Suzaku/WAM were 
reported by Cummings et al. (GCN Circ. 5443) and by Yamaoka, et al. 
(GCN Circ. 5462).  The Konus-Wind best fit spectral parameters for a 
power-law time exponential cutoff model are:  alpha = -0.65 (-0.12, +0.11), 
Epeak = 214 (-15, +17) keV (chi2/dof = 81/59).  Our joint fit spectral 
parameters in a power-law time exponential cutoff model are consistent 
within 90% confidence level with the spectral parameters derived by individual 
instruments.  However, we do see a systematic difference in the spectral 
parameters in the Band function fit especially in the low energy photon 
index alpha.  We are still working on the cross-calibration among three 
instruments.  

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

(GCN 5743) on October 22, 08:07UT, 16.5h after the burst, using FORS1/VLT
and grism 300V. At the time of the observation, the OT had a magnitude of
about R=20.5, based on photometric zeropoints from the ESO webpages.

The spectrum displayed a smooth continuum with no emission or absorption
lines, although the S/N of the source was resonably high. From the lack of
the Ly-alpha forest, a firm upper limit of z<2.0 can be placed on the
redshift of the GRB. This is consistent with the UVOT observations (GCN
5745).

The proposed optical counterpart of GRB 000301C (Fynbo et al GCN 570,
Bernabei et al. GCN 571) was observed with HST/STIS-PRISM mode during
four orbits totaling 8000s from 6.26 to 6.49 March 2000 (UT).  The
MAMA NUV detector with sensitivity from 1175A to 3400A was used.  Data
reductions were performed with STIS GTO IDL tools using prelaunch
spectral dispersion constants and on-orbit sensitivity calibrations.

A spectrum is detected with a peak S/N ~ 10 beginning at ~2650A,
extending to ~3250A with an average flux of ~4.6+/-0.2E-18 ergs/cm2/sec.  
The emission is 2.2 pixels FWHM (0.055 arcseconds) along the slit 
indicating a point source with no obvious diffuse extension. The 
spectrum appears relatively flat (in f_lambda) from 3200A to 2750A and 
then presents a sharp drop at about 2700A.

Within the present calibration uncertainties, the observed spectrum is
well fitted by a model using the power-law spectral index determined
by Halpern et al. (GCN 585), the observed V = 21.9 magnitude from the
STIS CCD images obtained on 6.2 March (Fruchter et al. GCN 602) a
moderate amount of extinction in the restframe of the OT, and a Lyman
limit break at ~2700A.

Assuming the Lyman break is caused by neutral hydrogen in the host
galaxy, the redshift of GRB 000301C is 1.95 +/- 0.1 where the large
error bar is due almost entirely to the present uncertainty in the
STIS UV prism calibration.  We expect a more accurate calibration
shortly.

We encourage ground-based observations at a predicted Lyman alpha
wavelength of 3585+-120A. H alpha would be at ~1.95 microns.

Si II 1526, C IV 1550, Fe II 1608, Al II 1670.  The weighted mean absorption 
redshift of this 16-line system is z = 2.0335 +- 0.0003.

This is fully consistent with the redshift estimate from the HST spectroscopy, 
z = 1.95 +- 0.1 (Smette et al., GCN 603), based on the ostensible Lyman break.
We thus consider our redshift determination to be secure, and interpret it as 
the redshift of the GRB host galaxy, with no intervening foreground systems.

The restframe equivalent widths of the absorption lines are in the range of
interstellar medium in the host galaxy.

Assuming z = 2.0335, and a simple Friedmann cosmology with H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, 
Omega_0 = 0.2, and Lambda_0 = 0, the luminosity distance is D_L = 5.11e28 cm, 
the distance modulus is (m-M) = 49.1 mag, and the relativistic (1+z)**4 
surface brightness dimming factor is 4.8 mag.  This may account for the lack 
of a detection of the host galaxy in the HST images (Fruchter et al., GCN 602).

""We observed the optical afterglow (Cenko & Fox, GCN 6028) of GRB

Our spectral coverage is 6000-10,000 A for the first hour and

We confirm the absence of prominent absorption features noted in
contemporaneous optical spectra from the Lick 3m (Prochaska et al.,
GCN 6031) and Keck-I (Prochaska et al., GCN 6032) telescopes.

At the same time, we identify a single weak (EW < 1 A) absorption
doublet at observer-frame wavelengths 7122.9 A + 7140.9 A.  Distinct
components of the doublet are well detected in separate spectra from
the first and second hour of observations, and the relative strength
of the two systems is consistent with their identification as the Mg
II (2796.4 A, 2803.5 A) doublet in absorption at redshift z=1.547.

We therefore conclude that GRB 070125 is at redshift z>1.547.  As
noted by Prochaska et al. (GCN 6032), the absence of Lyman-alpha

The ecliptic latitudes band of GRB 070201

The coordinates of the portion of the Wind-INTEGRAL annulus
reported in GCN 6088 and the map posted at

are correct
(more accurate coordinates of the intersection the
ecliptic latitude lower limit (+30) with the center of
the annulus are RA, Dec = 13.471,   +38.601 deg).

We apologize for the confusion and thank Derek Fox,
Eran Ofek, and Daniel Perley for pointing out the error.

As was noted by Perley and Bloom (GCN 5947)
the burst location area includes the M31 galaxy's outer
spiral arms.

The position of NGC 5985 galaxy suggested by Ofek (GCN 6092)
is definitely out of the burst location area.
The confusion was caused by the error in the reported ecliptic
latitude band.

Preliminary analysis shows that the burst had a
fluence of 1.57(-0.21, +0.06)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and the 2-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.016 s
9.4(-2.9,+1.7)x10^-4  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

Assuming this burst originated from a source in M31 (D ~770 kpc),
the isotrpoic energy release would be ~1x10^45 erg,
which is between the energy release in initial pulse
of the 5th March 1979 giant flare from SGR 0526-66 (~2x10^44 erg)
and the 27th December 2004 giant flare from SGR 1806-20 (~2x10^46 erg).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+0.256 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 0.98(-0.11, +0.10)
and Ep = 293 (-31, +38) keV (chi2 = 39/40 dof).

The spectrum of the burst maximum
(from T0 to T0+0.064 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 0.52(-0.15, +0.14)
and Ep = 357 (-38, +44) keV (chi2 = 39/40 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

The combined spectrum does not display any obvious absorption 
features. However, a firm upper limit of z < 2.3 can be placed on 
the redshift of GRB 070508 from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in 
the spectrum of the afterglow. This is consistent with the UVOT 
observations (Marshall & Grupe, GCN 6392).

We do detect a tentative emission line at 6781 A. If it corresponds 
to H-alpha at z = 0.033, we would expect to detect H-beta and the 
[O III] doublet in our spectrum. However, no features are visible 
at their predicted locations. The most probable association is with 
[O II] 3728, corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.82. We caution
that the magnitude reported above is then most likely affected by
host galaxy emission.

- From the spectral parameters obtained with the Konus-WIND data

we obtain: pz = 1.15 +/- 0.15

- From the spectral parameters obtained with the Swift-BAT data

Spectral lag analysis of the two main emission episodes in GRB 070612A,
described in GCN Circ. 6522 (Barthelmy et al.) indicate that this burst
has relatively long lags, comparable to and longer than that of GRB 980425

For the first, brighter FRED-like pulse structure, the lag measurement
between BAT energy bands 15-25 keV and 50-100 keV (25-50 and 100-350 keV)
is 2.5 s +2.1-1.8 s (2.5 +0.7-0.5 s).

lag is 5.8 s +2.6-1.9 s.  The flux in the 100-350 keV band for this

instrument is chosen from T0(WAM) to T0(WAM)+2 sec where 
T0(WAM) is the trigger time of WAM at 04:59:29.247 UTC.  
The energy ranges which we used in the joint spectral analysis 
are 14-150 keV and 100-2000 keV for Swift/BAT and Suzaku/WAM 
respectively.  The spectral data of two instruments are fit 
with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to 
take into account the systematic uncertainties in the response 
matrices of each instrument.  

The spectrum is well fit with a power-law with exponential cutoff 
model (dN/dE ~ E^{alpha} * exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak)).  The constant 
factors of each instrument agree within 10%.  No systematic residual 
from the best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  
The best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = -0.86 +- 0.10 and 
Epeak = 1120 (-380/+780) keV (chi2/dof = 64/69).  The energy fluence 
in the 15-2000 keV band calculated by a power-law with exponential

2: RA = 02:12:33.03, Dec = -02:11:41.6

1.6"" away. We estimate R~23.8 and R~24.3 on Jul 22.319 UT (21.6 hr after 
the GRB) for objects #1 and #2, respectively.

We acquired spectra for both objects. Thanks to the detection of a DLA 
and several metallic lines, we infer for object #2 a redshift z=3.626. 
The spectrum is typical of a GRB afterglow, and we thus suggest that 
object #2 is the optical counterpart of GRB 070721B. This redshift is 
also consistent with the nondetection of the object in filters bluer

We obtained spectra of several sources around the reported XRT positions
of GRB70810B (GCN 6754 , Starling et al.) on Aug. 11, 12:30 UT, using Keck
I + LRIS. No new source is seen in imaging of the field at the same time.
At the position of source 1 (""S1"") from Starling et al., there is no
optical counterpart visible. From further analysis of the X-ray data, we
detect another weak X-ray source at RA 00:35:46.892, DEC 08:51:05.96
(""S3"") which includes a weak optical source.
Within the BAT error circle, there is an early type galaxy (LEDA 1354367)
as noted first in Marshall et. al, GCN 6743, for which we determined a
redshift of z=0.0385 derived from Ca H&K absorption lines.
Around source 2 (""S2""), there are four galaxies of which two show strong
emission lines leading to a redshifts around z=0.49 from OII, OIII and the
Balmer series. The two other galaxies have marginal detections of emission
lines at the same redshift and these galaxies might therefore be part of a
cluster or even interacting.

We performed the Swift/BAT, and Suzaku/WAM joint fit spectral
analysis of GRB 070911 (Swift-BAT trigger #290624; Krimm, et al.,
GCN Circ. 6777).  The time interval of the spectral data for each
instrument is chosen from T0(WAM)-56 to T0(WAM)+149 sec where
T0(WAM) is the trigger time of WAM at 05:58:20.069 UTC.
The energy ranges which we used in the joint spectral analysis
are 14-150 keV and 100-1000 keV for Swift/BAT and Suzaku/WAM
respectively.  The spectral data of two instruments are fit
with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to
take into account the systematic uncertainties in the response
matrices of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fit with a power-law with exponential cutoff
model (dN/dE ~ E^{alpha} * exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak)).  The constant
factors of each instrument agree within 10%.  No systematic residual
from the best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.
The best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = -1.6 +- 0.1 and
Epeak = 170 (-50/+280) keV (chi2/dof = 59/74).  The energy fluence
in the 15-1000 keV band calculated by a power-law with exponential
cutoff model for this 205 sec interval is 2.1 (-0.2/+0.4) x 10^-5 erg/cm2
(assuming the constant factor of the BAT is fixed to 1).

Gemini Nod & Shuffle spectroscopy on the host of GRB 070714B shows a 
single emission line at 7165 A.  A photometric redshift based on Gemini 
grizJHK observations with GMOS and NIRI strongly implies that this is 
the 3727 A [O II] line.  This places the host at a redshift of z=.92

The Swift BAT discovery data show the burst to have had a short, hard 
main component of three seconds duration followed by a soft, longer 
duration tail (Sakamoto et al. GCN 6623).  The main component also shows 
a small spectral lag (Norris et al. GCN 6631).  Both of these 
observations are consistent with GRB 070714B being a short GRB.  This 
then would be the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift of a 
short burst.

The observed fluence of 7.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm^2 (Barbier et al. GCN 6638)

We observed GRB 071003 (Schady et al., GCN 6837) with Keck/HIRESr 
starting at UT 10:24 for one exposure of 1700s.  The data were acquired 
through very high airmass and have a low S/N ratio (~1 per 1.3 km/s 
pixel at 5000A).

We identify no obvious absorption features in either the 2D image nor 1D 
spectrum.  Allowing for the following priors, we place the following 
upper limits on the GRB redshift:

1.  Assuming the GRB host galaxy would emit no flux below the Lyman 
limit, we infer z_GRB < 3.4

2.  Assuming the GRB host galaxy would imprint a damped Lya profile on 
the spectrum, we infer z_GRB < 2.5

3.  Assuming the GRB host galaxy would imprint a strong MgII absorber on 
the spectrum (EW > 1A), we infer z_GRB < 1.

Given these constraints and the U-band detection from Mishra et al. (GCN 
6840), it is possible that this GRB is at low redshift.  We encourage 
follow-up observations to search for, or place limits on, a low-redshift 
host galaxy or associated supernova.",No Redshift,GRB 071003,Keck/HIRES,Spectroscopic

M. W. Auger (UC Davis) report on behalf of GRAASP:

We obtained spectroscopic follow-up of the bright transient associated 
with GRB 071003 (Schady et al., GCN 6837; Li, GCN 6838) starting at 
07:51 UT on the night of 2007-10-04 using Keck I + LRIS (range 3300-8630 
Angstroms).  Two 10-minute exposures were acquired.

The source is well-detected and a preliminary reduction reveals a smooth 
spectrum consistent with a GRB afterglow with multiple absorption-line 
systems.  We identify a pair of absorption features at 5870 and 5886 
Angstroms with the Mg II 2796, 2803 Angstrom doublet at a redshift of 
1.100.  Other absorption features are consistent with Fe II 2382, 2586, 
and 2599 Angstroms at this redshift.  This absorption system sets a 
lower limit on the redshift of the GRB of z=1.100.

In addition, numerous lines (e.g., Mg II 2796, 2803 Angstroms, Mg I 2852 
Angstroms, and Fe II 2599 Angstroms) are present from an intervening 
absorption system at z=0.372.

No strong supernova features or host-galaxy emission lines are seen in 
the spectrum.

This suggests that the transient is a GRB afterglow undergoing a bright 
late-time optical flare, similar to the afterglow of GRB 070311 (e.g. 
Halpern & Armstrong, GCN 6203; Guidorzi et al., astroph/0708.1383), 
rather than a supernova.  That flare peaked at R~22 approximately two 
days after the burst. Improved photometry of the optical transient 
associated with GRB 071003 gives a magnitude of R = 19.1 +/- 0.3 at 
04:49 UT (0.88 days after the trigger) and further rebrightening appears 
possible. Further monitoring is strongly encouraged.",1.100,GRB 071003,Keck I + LRIS,Spectroscopic

a 1800s spectrum with the grism 600B (with a resolution of R = 780) on 
Oct 04.055 UT (~ 0.735 days after the burst), under good seeing 
conditions (1.0"").

The detection of a MgII system at z=1.100 (Perley et al. GCN 6850), 
cannot be confirmed by our data, because the 2803 AA component of the 
MgII doublet is contamined by the NaI 5891 and 5897 AA doublet of the 
nearby bright star.

We also find significant lines at 5417 and 5430 AA, which we interpret 
as the MgII absorption doublet at 2797 and 2803 AA at z=0.937. FeII 2382 
is also detected at the same redshift.

In addition, we find two more significant absorption lines (5417 and 
5446 AA), that can be identified as Ca H and K at z=0.372. 
Alternatively, the 5446 AA line can be interpreted as the  2803 AA 
component of the MgII doublet at z=0.942, with the 2797 AA component 
sharing the absorption feature at 5430 AA with the MgII 2803 of the 
system at z=0.937. This can be another line-locking example like that of 
the CIV system of GRB 021004 at z=2.3 (Fiore et al. 2005, ApJ, 624, 853; 
Starling et al. 2005, MNRAS, 360, 305 ).

Finally, we find another MgII doublet at ~4000 AA (z=0.370), not 
consistent with the Ca system at z=0.372. No emission lines are visible.

In summary our analysis of the FORS2 spectrum puts a lower limit on the 
redshift of GRB 071003 to z=0.937.

Using FORS2 on the Very Large Telescope, we have obtained 
a 10 min spectrum (grism 300V) of the optical afterglow 
(OA) of GRB 071020 (Holland et al., GCN 6949). The acquisition 
image shows the proposed OA (Schaefer et al., GCN 6948) to

The spectrum displays Fe II (2586,2600) and the Mg II 
doublet (2796,2803) in absorption corresponding to a redshift 
of z = 2.145 (based on a preliminary wavelength calibration). 
Hence, the GRB is unrelated to the nearby z = 0.0166 galaxy
reported by Yuan et al. (GCN 6951).

We note that this is a lower limit to the GRB redshift.
There is some indication of a flux drop in the OA spectrum

""We observed the field of GRB 071021 (Sakamoto et al. GCN 6958) with  
PAIRITEL (*) starting at 2007-10-22 04:53 UT in high wind and poor  
seeing conditions at Mt Hopkins, Arizona. In the first 1340 second  
stack, the IR source noted by Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN 6968/6971) is  
not detected to J=18.35 mag, H=16.87 mag, Ks=16.43 (2.5 sigma upper  
limit). This is not particularly constraining in light of the deep  
Subaru imaging (Terada et al. GCN 6976) at a similar epoch.

  We note that despite the z-band detection (Malesani et al. GCN  
#6972) the very high-redshift hypothesis of Sakamoto et al. (GCN  
6967) is not yet ruled out. In particular, in high z QSO spectra  
there can be some transmitted flux (in the z-band filter  
transmission) through the Lyman-alpha forest between ~8000 Ang and  
8500 Ang (see, e.g., Fan et al. 2006 **) for z > 6.3 sources. So long  
as the redshifted Lyman limit at the redshift of the emitting source  
is blueward of ~8500 Ang, this light would not be entirely  
suppressed. This consideration yields an upper limit:

                         (1 + z_GRB)*912 Ang < 8500 Ang
                                     z_GRB <~ 8.3

  At such redshifts, say z_GRB = 8, all reported long-wavelength  
observations to-date would be naturally accommodated:

  - the deep non-detections at R and i-band (Berger & Covarrubias,  
GCNs 6973,6974), being blueward of 912*[1+z_GRB])
   - the faint detection at z-band (GCN 6972) due transmitted flux  
between 912*[1+z_GRB] = 8200 and 8500 Ang is allowed (as above)
   - the afterglow detections at H and K (GCN 6968; Terada et al. GCN  
6976)
   - the apparent faintness of J-band flux (GCN 6968) relative to H  
and K given the Gunn-Peterson trough would extend to (1 + z_GRB)*1216  
Ang =~ 1.1 micron.

  All of this assumes that the z-band source is not a foreground  
galaxy (in which case a higher-z GRB suggested by Castro-Tirado et  
al. is allowed).  If indeed the GRB originated from z > 7, we would  
expect to see what would resemble emission lines between lam_obs =  
912*[1+z_GRB] and ~8500 Ang, motivating the utility of *optical*  
spectroscopy of this source. Even without spectroscopy, when final  
magnitudes are reported along with filter transmission curves, a full  
SED should be illuminating.""

on behalf of a larger collaboration:

Using FORS1 on the Very Large Telescope, we obtained 
2*20 min spectra (grism 300V+GG375 covering 4000-8000 A) 
of the GRB 060602A host galaxy on 28 December 2006. A firm 
upper limit of z < 2.3 can be placed on the host redshift 
from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in the combined 
spectrum.

We do detect a strong emission line at 6664 A. If it 
corresponds to H-alpha at z = 0.015, we would expect to 
detect H-beta and the [O III] doublet in our spectrum. 
However, no features are visible at their predicted 
locations. In addition, this redshift would imply a very 
faint absolute magnitude of M_R = -10.3.

If the emission line corresponds to [O III] 5008 at 
z = 0.331, we would expect to detect [O II] 3728 which we 
do not. The most probable association is with [O II] 3728, 
corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.787. 

Using the relations by Kennicutt (1998, ARA&A, 36, 189), 
the flux of the proposed [O II] line corresponds to a star 
formation rate (SFR) of approximately 1.9 M_Sun/year. This 
value has not been corrected for host extinction, and is 
therefore a strict lower limit to the actual SFR. The 
specific SFR is around 13.6 M_Sun/year (L/L*)^-1, typical 
for GRB host galaxies (Christensen et al., 2004, A&A, 425, 913).",z = 0.787,GRB 060602A,Very Large Telescope (VLT),Spectroscopic

report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have flux calibrated the VLT spectrum of the GRB 071112C
optical afterglow (Jakobsson et al., GCN 7076). We clearly
detect four emission lines: [O II] 3727, [Ne III] 3869 and
[O III] 4960,5008. Using the relations by Kennicutt (1998,
ARA&A, 36, 189), the flux of the [O II] line corresponds to
a star formation rate (SFR) of approximately 0.5 M_Sun/year.
This value has not been corrected for host extinction or slit
loss, and is therefore a strict lower limit to the actual SFR.

The flux ratio of [Ne III] and [O II] is typical of GRB
host galaxies, with log([Ne III]/[O II]) ~ -0.5 (see Fig 4
in Wiersema et al., arXiv:0706.1345v1). The presence of
such strong emission lines in the OA spectrum indicates
a fairly bright host, approximately 24 < R < 25 (see also
Nugent & Bloom, GCN 7069).

We observed the field of GRB 071117 (Ukwatta et al., GCN 7098) with the 
ESO VLT, starting on 2007 Nov 18.005 UT (9.28 hr after the GRB). We 
clearly detect the two sources indicated by Bloom (GCNs 7105, 7110), 
including the afterglow s2. Source s1 appears extended in our images, 
while source s2 is indeed pointlike (seeing 0.85""). A faint nebulosity 
is apparent surrounding both objects.

A VLT spectrum was obtained with the FORS1 instrument starting on 2007 
Nov 18.03 UT, placing both sources on the slit. Three exposures of 30 
min each were secured. The afterglow spectrum shows a faint, blue 
continuum between 3700 to 9000 A, and a weak emission line is apparent 
at 8688 A. Interpreting this as [OII], we infer a redshift of z=1.331, 
which we consider as the likely redshift of the GRB. Interpreting the 
observed line as [OIII] or Halpha, we would expect to detect [OII] at 
6466 or 4934 A, respectively, which we do not see. A more conservative 
upper limit to the GRB redshift comes from the nondetection of any 
dropout in the blue down to 3800 A, which implies z < 2.1.

The spectrum of s1 is very red, with no significant flux below 5000 A. A

C. Thoene (DARK) report:

On the night of 2007-07-18 we re-observed the field of GRB 070429B (GCN 
6358, Markwardt et al.), likely to be a short-hard burst (T90 = 0.5 +- 
0.1 s, GCN 6365, Tueller et al.) under photometric conditions using the 
Keck I telescope + LRIS, in g and R filters simultaneously for a total 
integration of 930s(g) / 840s(R) under relatively poor seeing.  We 
further imaged the field using GMOS on Gemini-South on 2007-11-27 for 
1200s in r filter under excellent seeing.

The bright source reported by Cucchiara et al. (GCN 6368), designated 
object ""A"" by Antonelli et al. (GCN 6372) and likely the host galaxy of 
the GRB, is well-detected in R and r and weakly detected in g.  Using 
Landolt standard stars we measure an aperture magnitude for this object 
(in a 2.1"" radius aperture) of

g = 24.79 +/- 0.14
R = 23.24 +/- 0.05

This is consistent within errors with the magnitudes reported by 
Cucchiara et al. and Antonelli et al. 4 and 5 hours after the burst, 
respectively.  Image subtraction of the new Gemini imaging versus the 
earlier epoch (GCN 6368) reveals no variability to a limiting magnitude 
of R > 24.5, ruling out an afterglow contribution in the first epoch 
(4.84 hours after the burst) at this level.

Object ""B"" is also detected in both filters, and also shows no evidence 
for variability.


On the night of 2007-10-09 we performed longslit spectroscopy covering 
both targets (""A"" and ""B"") in two integrations of 1500s each, using Keck 
I + LRIS.

The trace of object ""A"" is faint and the spectrum is mostly featureless, 
but a faint line signature is observed centered at 7098 Angstroms, with 
a FWHM of 6 Angstroms.  The feature appears present in both exposures, 
though this site is severely affected by a cosmic ray in one exposure. 
We identify this feature as most likely being the [OII]3727 doublet. 
Other line identifications (H-alpha, H-beta, or [OIII]) are disfavored 
due to the absence of corroborating lines that would be expected over 
our spectral range (3500-8900 Angstroms) in those cases.

Association of this feature with [OII] indicates a redshift for this 
object of z=0.904.  Calibrating relative to R-band photometry, we 
estimate a preliminary line flux of 3e-17 erg/s/cm^2, corresponding to 
an unextincted star formation rate (Kewley et al. 2002) of 0.7 M_sun/yr, 
comparable to that observed in previous short burst hosts.  We note also 
the red color of this galaxy.

I have applied our time-dependent pileup correction code (Butler &
Kocevski 2007; ApJ, 663, 407) to the XRT spectrum of GRB080319B (see, Racusin
et al., GCN 7459).  Although I find similar temporal properties in the     
afterglow decay to those quoted by the XRT team, I find significantly
different spectral properties.  Notably, there is no significant evidence
for a time-variation in N_H and no significant need for a thermal component.
The WT model (0.4-10 keV) and PC mode (0.3-10 keV) spectra fitted jointly
and well (chi^2/nu=799.70/788) with an absorbed powerlaw yields:

Gamma = 1.84+/-0.01
N_H = 1.7+/-0.1 x 10^21 cm^(-2) @ z=0.937 (Vreeswijk et al., GCN 7451), in 
  addition to the expected Galaxy contribution along the line of sight.  Here 
  we assume the solar chemical abundances from Anders & Ebihara (1982).
  This value of N_H implies ~2 mag extinction in the observer frame V band
  assuming the mean Galactic dust+gas properties.

Allowing the photon indices to vary separately: Gamma1=1.84^{+0.1}_{-0.2} and 
Gamma2=1.85+/-0.05, closely consistent.  The fractional possible increase in 
rest-frame N_H between the WT mode data (t=660s to 4.95 ksec) and the PC mode 
data (t=4.95 to 174 ksec) is modest and weakly significant: 
0.74^{+0.43}_{-0.37}%.  I suspect the indicated variations are purely due to 
calibration uncertainties in the WT mode data.  The hard WT mode spectral fit 
in GCN 7459 can be reproduced by relaxing our pileup correction.

Additional evidence disfavors an interpretation of an evolving X-ray
spectrum:

Time resolved fits to the WT mode data show no significant evidence for
spectral evolution in the WT mode data considered alone. See,
http://astro.berkeley.edu/~nat/080319B_spec.jpg

The light curve is a simple (broken) powerlaw for the WT mode data, with
no flaring.  Afterglows with such light curves typically exhibit weak
or no spectral evolution (e.g., Butler & Kocevski 2007, ApJ, 668, 400).
There is no significant variations in the X-ray hardness ratio for this event.
See, http://astro.berkeley.edu/~nat/080319B_hardness.jpg

A fit to BAT data (see also, Cummings et al., GCN 7462) in a time     
region (58s to 303s; chi^2/nu=36.46/55) overlapping the XRT observation has
a roughly consistent powerlaw (Gamma=2.1+/-0.1), and also allows for a
smooth extrapolation in flux between BAT and XRT assuming a simple powerlaw
model connecting the flux in both instruments.

University, China) and Bing Zhang (University of Nevada Las Vegas) report:

We have processed the Swift XRT data of GRB 080319B, paying special 
attention to the possible spectral evolution in the WT mode data 
(Racusin et al. GCN 7459; cf. Butler GCN 7499). We perform a 
time-dependent spectral analysis using the method described in (Zhang, 
Liang & Zhang 2007, ApJ, 666, 1002). Since the early data are strongly 
affected by photon pile-up, we use a box annulus region for the WT mode 
data (outer radius 40*20, inner radius 8*20; see also Racusin et al. GCN 
7459) and time-dependent circle annulus regions for the PC mode data to 
extract spectra and lightcurves. We fit the time-dependent spectra using 
a simple power-law model with the absorption from the MilkyWay Galaxy 
(NH_G=1.12e20 cm^{-2} ) and from the host galaxy (NH_host=7.3e20 
cm^{-2}, obtained from fitting to the integrated 1st orbit WT mode 
spectrum). We confirm Butler (GCN 7499) that the apparent spectral 
evolution after 200 seconds is due to instrumental ""pile up"" effect. 
However, in the very early time t ~ (68-100) seconds, an apparent weak 
but significant hard-to-soft spectral evolution sustains even if we take 
into account the pile-up corrections. The photon index evolves from 1.67 
 0.02 to 1.77  0.02 during this period. Our results can be found at 
http://grb.physics.unlv.edu/~xrt/xrtweb/080319B/080319B.html.

To make sure that this early-time spectral evolution is not due to the 
pile-up effect, we extract the time-dependent spectra with box annuli 
having different sizes. By excluding the central regions, we enlarge the 
outer radius up to 80 pixel * 20 pixel to make sure that there are 
enough photons for the spectral analysis. Our tests show that even if 
the inner box size is as large as 30 pixel * 20 pixel (spectra in annuli 
with such a large inner radius is not possible to be affected by the 
pile-up effect), the early time (before 200 seconds) XRT WT data still 
show significant spectral evolution. We therefore cautiously conclude 
that this early spectral evolution is likely intrinsic.

Strong hard-to-soft spectral evolution has been seen in the early steep 
decay phase of many GRB X-ray afterglows (e.g. Zhang et al. 2007, 666, 
1002), which points towards a non-forward-shock origin of the emission. 
We notice that the lightcurve before 200 seconds show several weak 
flaring/flicking features, which is more easily seen in linear scale 
(see http://grb.physics.unlv.edu/~xrt/xrtweb/080319B/earlylc.png). In 
view that some steep decay segments with overlapping flares typically 
show hard-to-soft spectral evolution (Group C in Zhang et al. 2007), we 
suspect that the weak spectral evolution in this burst is also related 
to the weak flaring/flicking features. It is however puzzling why this 
segment naturally transforms to a smooth decay after 200 seconds which 
show no further spectral evolution.

Throughout our fit we have fixed the NH_host values. Another possibitly 
is that the apparent spectral evolution is caused by a varying NH_host 
value (Racusin et al. GCN 7459). We test such a scenario by fixing the 
photon index to \Gamma=1.76 (average value after 200s) and fit the 
time-dependent spectra before 200s using the same model 
(wabs*zbwas*zwabs) but allowing NH_host to be a free parameter.  We 
obtain acceptable fits, and found that the NH_host in the early time 
evolves dramatically to one half of its initiall valve (from ~ 1.1e21 
cm^{-2} to ~ 6.6e20 cm^{-2}). The time evolution of the NH_host value 
can be found at http://grb.physics.unlv.edu/~xrt/xrtweb/080319B/nh.png. 
This is another plausible physical scenario, although a model for the 
rapid depletion of NH_host is called for.

The reduced chi2 in our fitting to the wabs*zwabs*powerlaw model is 
typically ~1. Although a possible thermal component has been suggested 
(cf. Racusin et al. GCN 7459), in our fitting no thermal component is 
required by the data.

We performed the Suzaku/WAM and Swift/BAT joint fit spectral
analysis of GRB 080413A (Swift/BAT trigger #309096; Beardmore et al., 
GCN 7594).  The time interval of the spectral data for each 
instrument is chosen from T0(WAM)-1 to T0(WAM)+22 sec where
T0(WAM) is the trigger time of WAM at  02:54:18.648 UTC.  
This time interval includes the initial two peaks, but not 
the relatively soft third peak around T0(WAM)+45 sec which 
is clearly visible in the BAT data (Tueller et al., GCN 7604).  
The energy ranges which we used in the joint spectral analysis
are 13-150 keV and 150-1000 keV for Swift/BAT and Suzaku/WAM
respectively.  The spectral data of two instruments are fit
with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to
take into account the systematic uncertainties in the response
matrices of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fit with a power-law with exponential cutoff
model (dN/dE ~ E^{alpha} * exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak)).  The constant
factors of each instrument agree within 20%.  No systematic residual
from the best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.
The best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = -1.2 +- 0.1 and
Epeak = 170 (-40/+80) keV (chi2/dof = 75/73).  The energy fluence
in the 15-1000 keV band calculated by a power-law with exponential
cutoff model for this 23 sec interval is 4.8 (-1.2/+0.4) x 10^-6 erg/cm2
(assuming the constant factor of the BAT is fixed to 1).

Assuming z = 2.433 (Thoene et al., GCN 7602) and a standard

We have obtained spectroscopic observations of GRB 080430 from the 2.2m
Calar
Alto telescope (+CAFOS) starting at 21:11 UT (78 minutes after the
burst). The
observations consisted of 3x1200s integrations in low resolution. The
signal to noise
ratio is low but after a preliminary reduction we may conclude:

1) Continuum is clearly detected down to 3500 Angstroms, implying a
redshift smaller
than 1.9.
2) We detect an absorption feature at ~4900 Angstroms that we suggest to
be the
MgII doublet (2796.3, 2803.5), implying a most probable redshift of ~0.75.

Further analysis is ongoing. Additional spectroscopic observations are
encouraged.

For GRB 080503 (Trigger 310785, GCNs 7665 & 7673),
the spectral lag analysis of the data from T-1 sec to T+1 sec
(the initial spike), yields a lag of -13 +/- 9 msec for the
15-25 to 50-100 keV bands using lightcurve binnings of 4, 8 and 16 msec.
For the on-going emission (T+10 to T+220 sec), the signal is too weak
and lacking sufficient structure to yield a significant lag measurement.

Expanding on the total-burst spectral analysis in GCN 7673,
we have divided the burst into an initial phase (T+0.0 to T+0.7 sec)
and the extended phase (T+10 to T+170 sec).  The simple power law fits are:

The optical source identified by Fynbo et al. (GCN 7770) has clearly 
faded since our previous observation by at least 1.5 mag. This confirms 
that the object is the afterglow of GRB 080523. The refined coordinates 
(J2000, against USNO-B1.0) are

Close inspection of our spectra (Fynbo et al., GCN 7770) fails to reveal 
any convincing absorption or emission feature. The object has a blue 
continuum, and flux is detected down to ~4070 AA. A conservative limit 
to the redshift is set by the absence of Lyman-alpha forest redward of 
~4900 AA, which implies z < 3. This limit rules out a high redshift as 
suggested by the burst gamma-ray properties (Palmer et al., GCN 7772).

Given the very strong absorption lines reported in our spectroscopic

host galaxy of this burst, as suggested by Rumyantsev et al.  However, 
the sources above are offset significantly from the afterglow (which 
itself is not obviously extended), suggesting instead that they may 
represent one or both of the intervening absorbers.

Later the same night, we acquired 2x900s spectra using a slit covering 
the northern (afterglow) source and southern source, and an additional 
1x600 spectrum using a slit covering the faint western source and the 
bright, clearly separated eastern source noted by Kann et al. (GCN

of the host and absorber redshifts of z=1.688, z=1.563 and z=1.271 
respectively, the bright potential emission features (Ly-alpha, OII) are 
expected to fall outside our wavelength coverage, on top of sky lines, 
or be strongly attenuated by the atmosphere, so this result is mildly

Compared to the measurement of Malesani et al. (R = 22.52 at 1.77 days,

were this the GRB afterglow, which is unlikely at such late times.  More 
likely, the source represents a relatively bright host galaxy of this burst.

However, analysis of a 2x1200s Gemini-North spectrum using GMOS taken at 
the afterglow location (offset <0.5"" from the host from a comparison 
from the Gemini i-band acquisition image) 1.9 days after the GRB shows 
no significant emission or absorption features over the usable spectral 
range from 4000-6720 Angstroms.  The continuum flux extends all the way 
to 4000 Angstroms without evidence of Lyman-alpha forest absorption, 
which imposes a redshift constraint of z < 2.3.  Further follow-up is 
encouraged.

GRB 070809 was a short-hard burst (Barthelmy et al., GCN 6788) detected 
by Swift.  In our observations on 2007-08-10 and 2007-08-11 we detected 
a very faint optical afterglow candidate and presented evidence (at 
about the 3-sigma level) for fading between the two nights.  (GCNs 6739, 
GCN 6774).

On the night of 2008-02-10, we re-imaged the field using Keck I (+LRIS), 
again in R and g filters simultaneously, for a combined 2550s (R) and 
2820s (g).  We unambiguously confirm the fading behavior of the optical 
transient, with no detection in either filter to R > 25.0, g > 26.3.  We 
rule out the presence of a host galaxy coincident with the transient 
location to the same level.  (An color image of the field is posted to 
http://lyra.berkeley.edu/~dperley/070809/070809host.png.  A comparison 
between the early- and late-time imaging is available at 
http://lyra.berkeley.edu/~dperley/070809/070809compare.png)

Several other short bursts with no strictly coincident host galaxy have 
been found to be close in physical projection to relatively low-redshift 
galaxies (e.g. Bloom et al. 2006, 2007, Stratta et al. 2007, Troja et 
al. 2008).  This burst is not an exception, with an edge-on spiral 
galaxy centered at an offset of 5.6"" to the northwest.  Photometry of 
this source gives magnitudes of R = 21.7 +/- 0.3, g = 22.7 +/- 0.2 (the 
relatively large uncertainties are due to the extended nature of the 
source and the variable background due to the presence of a nearby 
bright star).

On the night of 2008-06-07 we obtained 2x900s of spectroscopy of this 
source using Keck I (+LRIS), with a PA aligned with the orientation of 
the galaxy.  The galaxy is well contained within the 1 arcsec slit.  Two 
relatively bright emission lines are detected - one at 4542.0 A and one 
at 6100.1 A.  Associating these lines with [O II] and [O III], 
respectively, the redshift of this galaxy is z=0.2187.  No other 
emission lines are significantly detected.

The line flux of the [O II] doublet is ~2 x 10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 
(correcting for Galactic extinction of E(B-V) = 0.09), corresponding to 
an uncorrected star formation rate (Kewley et al. 2002) of ~0.15 
M_sun/year.  As the galaxy is edge-on this is likely to be well below 
the actual value.  The velocity dispersion of the galaxy along the slit 
axis is 110 +/- 20 km/s, which over the observed radius of 1.8"" (=6.3 
kpc) gives a mass of 1.8 x 10^10 M_sun.  These values suggest a 
relatively small spiral galaxy.

While this galaxy is not particularly massive or luminous, the close 
proximity (20 kpc in projection at z=0.2187) and lack of a coincident 
host is strongly suggestive of association given previous short bursts. 
  However, we issue several caveats:

- Some short bursts have been shown to have secure hosts at z~1 (e.g. 
060801, 070429B and 070714B:  Berger et al. 2007, GCN 6836, GCN7140, 
Cenko et al. 2008.; see Berger 2008 for a review), and our limiting 
magnitudes do not rule out relatively underluminous galaxies at this 
redshift.

- One other probable galaxy is present somewhat closer to the afterglow, 
a very faint (R = 24.6, g = 25.7) source 2.3"" away from the OT position. 
  The probability of chance association of the afterglow position with 
this source (if it is a galaxy) based on galaxy count/offset statistics 
is higher than the probability of association with the spiral (~10% vs. 
~5%), though they are comparable.  The source is at unknown redshift.

- It is possible (but unlikely, GCN 6788) that this event is not a short 
burst, in which case a even higher-redshift origin would not be surprising.

At a redshift of z=0.2187, the isotropic energy release for this burst 
would be E_iso = 1.1 * 10^49 erg in the observed 15-150 keV band.

We observed the field of GRB 080707 (Schady et al., GCN 7947) with the 
ESO VLT equipped with FORS1.

Inside the XRT error circle, we detect the object first reported by 
Clemens et al. (GCN 7948) in the R and I bands. The source had R ~ 19.6 
on 2008 Jul 7.385 UT (47 min after the trigger), calibrated against 
USNO-B1. This object is not visible in the DSS (which reaches a deeper 
limit) and seems brighter than in the later observation reported by 
Clemens et al. (GCN 7948). It is thus very likely the optical afterglow 
of GRB 080707. A finding chart is posted at

FORS1 spectra were acquired between Jul 7.397 and 7.441 UT with grism 
300V. From detection of FeII and MgII absorption features, we infer a 
redshift z = 1.23. A conservative upper limit z < 2.2 can be set from 
the lack of Lyman alpha forest in the blue

Following the Swift detection of GRB080721 (Marshall et al., GCN 7988), 
we triggered observations with the DOLORES low resolution spectrograph, 
mounted at the Italian TNG telescope located in the Canary Islands 
(Spain). The observations were performed using the LR-B grism. We took a 
1800 s spectrum starting around Jul 21 at 21:30 UT (about 11.0 hours

R ~ 600.

A preliminary analysis of the spectra shows a broad absorption feature 
at lambda_obs ~ 440 nm (based on a preliminary wavelength calibration). 
Interpreting this feature as Ly-alpha we infer a redshift z = 2.602, in 
agreement with the UVOT photometric redshift estimate (Holland et al.,

(rest frame) other absorption features like: CII (133.4 nm), SiIV

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 080721 (Marshall et al., GCN 7988;

La Palma. The afterglow is well detected in a single 300 s exposure
starting on 21.875 July 2008 (10.6 hr after the GRB). Comparison with
several USNO-B1 stars (R1 magnitudes) yields R = 20.0 +/- 0.2, where most
of the error comes from the calibration. Using the R-band magnitude
provided by Chen et al., the inferred decay index is alpha ~ 0.9.

Low resolution spectra (3 x 30 min) were also obtained. The combined
spectrum displays a strong absorption feature around 4350 A, with the flux
dropping substantially blueward of this feature. Associating it with
Ly-alpha gives a redshift of z ~ 2.6 for the burst. We find several other
absorption features, including O I, Si II, C II, Si IV, C IV, Fe II

Since telescope pointing constraints did not allow a prompt observation of

(Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405), mounted at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope 
at La Silla Observatory (Chile), started observations in g'r'i'z'JHK only 
on Jul 27, 23:08 UT, nearly 15 hrs after the burst. Under mediocre conditions
a total of 90 min effective exposure in g'r'i'z' and 76 min in JHK was
collected. Correcting for foreground extinction of A_V = 6.15 (Schlegel et al.
1998), we measure the following AB magnitudes/limits:
g'>17.7, r'>19.7, i'>19.9, z'=19.8+-0.1, J=19.45+-0.15, H=19.2+-0.1,

The corresponding SED is well fit by a single power law with slope 0.85, 
with no evidence of additional (intrinsic) extinction, and with the 
i'-limit being consistent with that power law. Our SED power law has an 
extinction-corrected R-H=1.0. The best fit Hyper-z redshift to our data 
gives z=5.5-6.5, with a firm upper limit of 6.7. Given the non-constraining 
upper limits at i' and bluer, no lower limit can be placed. If the color 
R-H = 3.24 mag from the combination of KAIT (Li et al. 2008, GCN #8024)

of GRB 080805 from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in the

Report:

We performed the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis 
of GRB 080810 (Swift/BAT trigger #319584; Page et al., GCN Circ. 8080).  
Since the Konus-Wind observed this GRB in the waiting mode, we only 
have 3 channel spectral data for the Konus-Wind.  However, the 
Konus-Wind data covers the energy range from 20 keV to 1 MeV.  Therefore, 
the joint spectral analysis of the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data 
enables to derive the broad-band spectral parameters of this burst.  

The time interval of the spectral data for each instrument is chosen from 
T0(BAT)-18.6 to T0(BAT)+60.8 sec where T0(BAT) is the trigger time of BAT 
at 13:10:12.3 UTC.  This time interval includes most of the burst emission, 
but not the last pulse around T0(BAT)+~100 sec which is clearly visible in 
the BAT data (Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 8082).  The energy ranges which we 
used in the joint spectral analysis are 20-1000 keV and 14-150 keV for 
the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of two 
instruments are fit with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor 
to take into account the systematic uncertainties in the response matrices 
of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fit with a power-law with exponential cutoff model 
(dN/dE ~ E^{alpha} * exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak)).  The constant factors of each 
instrument agree within 20%.  No systematic residual from the best fit model 
is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  The best fit spectral 
parameters are: alpha = -1.2 +- 0.1 and Epeak = 550 (-230/+860) keV 
(chi2/dof = 41/58).  The best fit spectral parameters for the Band function 
fixing beta=-2.5 are: alpha = -1.2 +- 0.1 and Epeak = 580 (-260/+850) keV 
(chi2/dof = 41/58).  The energy fluence in the 15-1000 keV band calculated 
by a power-law with exponential cutoff model for this 79.5 sec interval is 1.7 
(-0.2/+0.1) x 10^-5 erg/cm2 (assuming the constant factor of the BAT is fixed to 1).  

Assuming z = 3.35 (Prochaska et al., GCN Circ. 8083; Burenin et al., 
GCN Circ. 8088) and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, 
Omega_M = 0.27, Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the isotropic energy release is 
E_iso ~5 x 10^53 erg in 1 keV to 10 MeV at the GRB rest frame extrapolating 
the best fit model spectrum.  

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.",z = 3.35,GRB 080810,Swift/BAT and Konus-Wind,Spectroscopic

We observed the field of GRB 080905B (Stroh et al., GCN 8182) with the 
ESO VLT equipped with FORS2. Several spectra were obtained with 
different grism choices, beginning on 2008 Sep 6.053  UT (8.34 hr after 
the GRB), and covering the wavelength ranges 3800-9500 AA at low to 
moderate resolution.

In the acquisition images, we clearly detect a point source inside the 
refined XRT error circle (Osborne et al., GCN 8189), at the coordinates 
(J2000):

RA = 20:06:57.90
Dec = -62:33:46.8

This position is consistent with that of the UVOT candidate afterglow 
reported by Stroh et al. (GCN 8182), the object being now significantly 
fainter (R ~ 20.2). We note that this position is 3.8"" off the center of 
the bright 2MASS galaxy 2MASX J20065732-6233465, also visible in the DSS 
and in the UVOT images.

Spectroscopy of the afterglow reveals resonance absorption features from 
several ions, including OI, SiII, CIV, FeII, AlII, AlIII, MgII, MgI, at 
a redshift z = 2.374. The detection of transitions from fine-structure 
levels of FeII indicates that this is the redshift of the GRB, under the 
assumption that these levels are populated by GRB afterglow ultraviolet

We have analyzed more data of our GROND observing run (Rossi et al. 2008, 
GCN #8218) of GRB 080913 (Schady et al. 2008, GCN #8217; Stamatikos et al.

several epochs. The position is

RA (2000.0) = 04:22:54.74 
Decl. (2000.) = -25:07:46.2

with an uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec. This position is consistent with the 
astrometrically corrected Swift X-ray position (Beardmore et al. 2008, 
GCN #8219).

z'-band data spanning the time period from 3 min to 3 hrs after the burst
clearly show a fading source and are well fit with a power law
of decay slope 0.6 +- 0.3. This confirms the fading seen with the VLT
(Vreeswijk et al. 2008, GCN #8221). If this fading continues, we predict
z(AB) ~ 25 mag at 24 hrs after the GRB.

The afterglow is detected in z'JHK, but not in g'r'i-bands. After
correction for foreground extinction of A_V=0.129, we obtain (AB system)

Observations started at 8:30, about 100 min after the GRB, and continued
until morning twilight. We detect a red continuum that disappears
bluewards of a break around 9400 AA. Interpreting this break
as the onset of the Lyman-alpha forest we infer a redshift
of about z=6.7 consistent with the photometric redshift determined

We performed the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis
of GRB 080913 (Swift/BAT trigger #324561: Schady et al., GCN Circ. 8217,
Stamatikos et al. GCN Circ. 8222).
Since the Konus-Wind observed this GRB in the waiting mode, we only
have 3 channel spectral data for the Konus-Wind which cover the energy
range from 20 keV to 1.3 MeV.  Therefore, the joint spectral analysis of
the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data enables to derive the broad-band
spectral parameters of this burst.

The time interval of the spectral data for each instrument is chosen
from  T0(BAT)-4.1 to T0(BAT)+4.7 sec where T0(BAT) is the trigger time
of BAT at 06:46:54.1 UTC.  The energy ranges which we used in the joint
spectral analysis are 20-1300 keV and 14-150 keV for the Konus-Wind and
the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of two instruments are
fit with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to take
into account the systematic effective area uncertainties in the response
matrices of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fit with a power-law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). The constant factors of each
instrument agree within 5%.  No systematic residual from the best fit
model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  The best fit
spectral parameters are: alpha = -0.89(-0.46, +0.65) and Epeak = 131
(-48/+225) keV (chi2/dof = 43.7/58).  The best fit spectral parameters
for the Band function fixing beta=-2.5 are: alpha = -0.82(-0.53, +0.75)
and Epeak = 121 (-39/+232) keV (chi2/dof = 43.9/58).  The energy fluence
in the 15-1000 keV band calculated by a power-law with exponential
cutoff model for this 8.8 sec interval is 8.5(-2.2, +6.0)x10^-7 erg/cm2

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

Assuming z = 6.7 (Fynbo et al., GCN Circ. 8225) and a standard cosmology
model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27, Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the
isotropic energy  release is E_iso ~7x10^52 erg in 1 keV to 10 MeV at
the GRB rest frame extrapolating the best Band function fit fixing
beta=-2.5.

Looking only at the parameters of the prompt emission, namely T90~1 sec
and Ep ~900 keV in the GRB rest frame, this burst could be classified as
a short burst.",z = 6.7,GRB 080913,Swift-BAT and Konus-Wind,Spectroscopic

The Swift/BAT data were reduced in a standard way. Making use of the
Cross Correlation Function (CCF) for different energy bands over 15-150
keV, we found negligible spectral time lags, being consistent with the
values/range of previous Swift short-duration GRBs. Also we note the
rest-frame energy band which BAT corresponds to for this burst (z~6.7,
Fynbo et al. GCN 8225) is higher than that for previous GRBs.

using Gemini-South with the GMOS-South spectrograph (R~1200).
We acquired 2x900s spectra which covered the wavelength range 4000A-8000A.

Our spectrum shows a flux cut-off blueward of 4500A indicating a likely DLA
associated with the GRB host galaxy, consistent with a redshift of z ~ 2.6.

We also identify multiple metal absorption features including FeII(2249),
FeII(2260), SiIV(1393), SiIV(1402), CIV(1548), CIV(1550), NiII(1741) and

The afterglow of GRB 080928 detected by Swift (Sakamoto et al., GCN
8292, see also Rykoff et al., GCN 8293) was observed with FORS2
mounted on the Antu telescope of ESO's VLT on Cerro Paranal, Chile.
Following an acquisition image, which was started at 6:31 UT on
September 29, 2008 (15.5 hr after the GRB trigger), a single 1800 s
spectrum was secured. It was taken with a 1"" slit and the 300V grism,
resulting in an approximate resolution of 11 A, and a useful
wavelength coverage of 3800-9300 A. From the 60 s acquisition image,
we measure an afterglow magnitude of R = 20.4 based on USNO-B1
magnitudes.

The extracted spectrum shows a multitude of significant absorption
lines, which we identify with common resonance lines of mainly MgII
and FeII, originating in at least two absorption systems at z=0.735
and z=1.692. The latter redshift presumably corresponds to that of the
GRB host galaxy. We do not find evidence for a spectral break due to
the Lyman alpha forest down to 3800 A, setting a firm upper limit on
the GRB redshift of z < 2.1. These results are consistent with the
redshift limits set by GROND (Rossi et al., GCN 8296) and UVOT (Kuin
et al., GCN 8298), but not with the value of z=2.49 reported by
Cucchiara et al. (GCN 8300).

The equivalent width of the MgII 2796 line of the z=0.735 system
(EW_rest ~ 4.3 A) is much larger than that of the z=1.692 system. We
note the presence of an R ~ 22 object, not covered by the slit, at
2.6"" NNE of the afterglow position, which could possibly be a bright
host galaxy, or the counterpart of the z=0.735 absorber. The slit
serendipitously covers a galaxy 30"" away from the afterglow (at
R.A. 06:20:13.35, decl. -55:11:55.0), which shows an apparent emission
line at 6470 A; this can be identified as [OII] 3727 at a redshift of
z=0.736. At this redshift, 2.6 and 30"" correspond to projected
distances of 19 and 219 kpc, respectively.

We re-processed the data acquired on GRB080928 in order to reconcile our

We acquired 2x900s spectra covering the wavelength range 4000A-8000A.

We detect a damped Lyman-alpha system (DLA) at redshift z=3.847.

We also detect several metal absorption features which we interpret as
SiIV(1393,1402), SiII1526 and 1260, SiII*1264, CI1560, CII1334, CII*1335,
CIV(1548,1550), FeII1608, NV(1238,1242) at the same redshift.

In combination with the strong metal absorption features, the detection of
a DLA at z=3.847 confirms that this is the redshift of GRB 081029 and its
host galaxy.

Our results are consistent with those of D'Elia et al. (GCN 8438).

kindly obtained at the WMKO Keck-II telescope by L. Cowie, A. Barger, et al.
on UT 2000 September 29.26, using the ESI instrument (an Echelle spectrograph).

identified by Fynbo et al. (GCN 807) as having z ~ 2.066.  However, we see 
no evidence for any other absorption systems in these data; in particular, 
the ostensible system at z = 1.378 proposed by Fynbo et al. is likely due to
line misidentifications.

We note that the line equivalent widths appear to be unusually strong in
comparison to the general population of metallic line absorbers seen in the
spectra of quasars, suggesting a high column density and/or metallicity of
the intervening gas.  A more detailed analysis is in progress.

Assuming Ly-alpha absorption, the g' band detection implies a redshift

The Galactic foreground corrected broad band SED is best fit with a 
power law template and significant extinction in the host. Depending 
on the used model, the  best fit intrinsic extinction A_V^{host} 
varies between 0.6 and 1.2. We caution however, that this is strongly

""We have performed spectral analysis of the GBM data for GRB 090323

GRB emission, because after that time the Fermi Observatory executed
a maneuver following this bright GRB, which caused rapid, significant
changes in the source angles of the various detectors and in the
background behaviour.

The spectrum from T0-2.0 s to T0+71.7 s is best fit by a power-law
function with a high-energy exponential cutoff. The power-law index
is -0.89 +/- 0.03, and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is
697 +/- 51 keV (chi squared 379.4 for 359 d.o.f.). At a redshift of
3.57 (GCN 9028), the Epeak in the GRB rest frame, Epeak_rest, is
3.19 +/- 0.23 MeV.

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.00 +/- 0.01)E-4 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+65.5 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 12.3 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

This time interval consists of two main emission peaks, from T0-2.0 s
to T0+33.8 s and from T0+33.8 s to T0+71.7 s. Both of these shorter
intervals are also best fit by a power-law function with a high-energy

We performed the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis
of GRB 090418A (Swift/BAT trigger #349510: Mangano et al., GCN Circ. 
9149, Fenimore et al. GCN Circ. 9157).
Since the Konus-Wind observed this GRB in the waiting mode, we only
have 3 channel spectral data for the Konus-Wind which cover the energy
range from 20 keV to 1.2 MeV.  Therefore, the joint spectral analysis of
the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data enables to derive the broad-band
spectral parameters of this burst.

The time interval of the spectral data for each instrument is chosen
from  T0(BAT)-6.7 to T0(BAT)+58.1 sec where T0(BAT) is the trigger time
of BAT at 11:07:40.2 UTC.  The energy ranges which we used in the joint
spectral analysis are 20-1200 keV and 14-150 keV for the Konus-Wind and
the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of two instruments are
fitted with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to take
into account the systematic effective area uncertainties in the response
matrices of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law with exponential cutoff 
model: dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). The constant factors 
of each instrument agree within 20%.  No systematic residual from the 
best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  The 
best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = -1.30 +/- 0.09 and Epeak = 
610(-164, +530) keV (chi2/dof = 37.0/57).  The best fit spectral 
parameters for the GRB (Band) model fixing beta = -2.5 are: alpha = -1.30 
+/- 0.09, and Epeak = 601(-215, +554) keV (chi2/dof = 37.1/57).  The 
energy fluence in the 15-1200 keV band calculated by a power-law with 
exponential cutoff model for this 64.8 sec interval is (1.79 +/- 
0.21)x10^-5 erg/cm2.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

Assuming z = 1.6 (Chornock et al., GCN Circ. 9151) and a standard 
cosmology model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27, Omega_Lambda = 
0.73, the isotropic energy  release is E_iso ~2x10^53 erg in 1 keV to 10 
MeV at the GRB rest frame extrapolating the best Band function fit 
fixing beta = -2.5.

We derive the following magnitudes, calibrated using three 2MASS stars

J mag: 19.29 +- 0.07
H mag: 17.71 +- 0.14

The resulting J-H color of 1.1 AB mag is very red, corresponding to a

H-K color (see GCN 9202), our non-detection in Y-band, and a red I-J
color of 1.7 AB mag in comparison to P60 limits (GCN 9201), we suggest
that there is a likely break in the spectrum at about 1.2 microns,
with extinction an unlikely explanation due to the sharpness of the
feature and the shallow slope to redder wavelengths.  If this is due
to Ly-alpha absorption, then the resulting redshift for GRB 090423 is

galactic extinction of E(B-V)=0.029 (Schlegel et al. 1998) and assuming no
intrinisic extinction, a fit with Hyper-z (Bolzonella et al. 2000) results

A preliminary analysis of the combined spectrum shows a very weak signal 
at the position of the NIR afterglow. No signal is observed below 
observed lambda ~ 10500 Angstrom. Assuming that the lack of signal at 
bluer wavelengths is due to Ly-alpha absorption in the IGM this gives a

chans 3->2:  0.044 +0.070 -0.052 seconds

For the peak 3 seconds of the burst we obtain:

chans 3->1:  0.021 +0.054 -0.032 seconds
chans 3->2:  0.006 +0.046 -0.071 seconds

where the channels are 15-25 keV, 25-50 keV, and 50-100 keV.  The lag 
in each case is consistent with zero, but the 1-sigma error bars are 
roughly as large as the median lag values for long bursts. Thus this 
burst is too dim for us to utilize lags as a discriminant for long vs. 
short.

Given the relatively short duration of this burst, it is informative to 
look at other possible indicators of whether the burst is in fact a 
short burst seen at a large distance.

The calculations below use z=8, which is roughly the average of the 
photometric and spectroscopic redshifts determined for this burst 
(Cucchiara et al., GCN 9213; Olivares et al., GCN 9215; Thoene et al., 
GCN 9216; Perley et al., GCN 9217; Tanvir et al., GCN 9219; 
Fernandez-Soto et al., GRB 9222).

When converted to the rest frame, the T90 values (10.3  1.1 sec, 
Swift/BAT 15-350 keV, Palmer et al., GCN 9204) and (12 sec, Fermi/GBM 
8-1000 keV, Kienlin, GCN Circ. 9229) transform to 1.1  0.1 sec and 
1.3 sec, respectively. However, one must be careful in comparing these 
numbers to the BATSE short-hard burst divide (Kouveliotou et al., 
ApJ 413, L101, 1993).  The  BATSE duration distribution is in the observer frame.  With a typical  redshift of z = 1-2 for BATSE bursts, the dividing 
line between long  and short in the rest frame is 0.7 to 1.0 seconds. 
Thus this burst is on the boundary and toward the long side.

While the duration and lag are consistent with short bursts (with large 
errors), there are other observations which are more consistent with 
GRB 090423 being a long burst in the source frame.

The spectral fits to the BAT data (Palmer et al., GCN 9204) are 
inconclusive as to whether this is a long or short burst. Both the photon 
index, alpha = 0.8 +/- 0.5, and Epeak = 440 keV in the source frame, from 
a cut-off power-law model fit, are consistent with the results for other 
short bursts detected by Swift/BAT.   However, these numbers also fall 
within the distributions for long bursts (Krimm et al., in preparation).

The main argument against this being a short burst is the isotopic energy.
The analysis performed by Amati et al. (GCN 9227) gives the burst 
Eiso=1053 erg and shows that the burst is consistent with the Epeak-Eiso relation for long bursts.  All previously known short bursts are outliers 
to this relation.   The calculated value of Eiso is a factor of > 50 greater than that for most other short bursts.

Furthermore it is questionable whether there would be sufficient time for 
a binary neutron star system to form and inspiral to a merger given the 
very early time interval since the Big Bang implied by z=8 (lookback time 
of ~13 Gyr, corresponding to an age of the universe of 0.6 Gyr).

In conclusion, we can not say if GRB 090423 is short or long.  Its  
duration in the source frame is at the boundary between the two  
classes, the lag analysis is inconclusive, the BAT spectral shape is  
inconclusive, the Amati relationship favors long burst and the merger  
time at such high redshift could be problematic for a short burst  
interpretation.",z=8,GRB 090423,Swift,Photometric and Spectroscopic

For GRB 090426 (Cummings et al GCN 9254), the spectral lag analysis
of the data from T-1 sec to T+2 sec yields a lag of -6 +/- 45 msec
for the 25-50 to 50-100 keV bands using light curve binnings of
16, 32 and 64 msec. With redshift of 2.609 (Levesque et al GCN 9264)
this lag value transforms to 1.7 +/- 12.5 ms in the GRB
rest frame. The lag is consistent with zero but has relatively large
uncertainty.

Furthermore, the observed T90 (1.2 +/- 0.3 sec; Swift/BAT 15-350 keV,
Sato et al., GCN 9263) and rest frame T90 (0.33 +/- 0.08 sec)
values suggest a short-hard burst. However, the spectral fit
to the BAT data (Sato et al., GCN 9263) indicates a relatively
soft spectrum (a power-law fit to the spectrum gives index
of 1.93 +/- 0.22).

In summary, the observed and rest frame T90 values for GRB 090426
point strongly toward a short-hard burst classification.
The spectral lag is consistent with zero, and the spectrum is
marginally softer than typical for a short-hard burst.
Our conclusion is that this burst could be either short or long,
but the BAT data leads toward a classification as short.",2.609,GRB 090426,GSFC,Spectroscopic

After correcting for a Galactic foreground extinction corresponding to a 
reddening of E_(B-V)=0.206 mag (Schlegel et al.), the g' to K band is well 
described with a single power law. This implies, that Lyman alpha is below

with the 300I grism  were obtained, covering an approximate wavelength
range of 6000-10000 Angstroms.

Preliminary analysis of the spectra reveals two emission lines at 7093
and 9250 Angstroms,  which we identify as [OII] and  Hbeta at a common
redshift of z=0.903 +/- 0.003. Furthermore, there are indications of a
spectral break  in the continuum  around 7600 Angstroms,  suggesting a
possible 4000A break at the same redshift.

The detection of  emission lines and the possible  4000A break suggest
the dominance of the underlying  host galaxy over the afterglow at the
time of our observations. It also confirms that host galaxies of short
GRBs are not  all old and dead ellipticals but  instead drawn from the
underlying  field galaxy  distribution (e.g.,  Berger 2009,  ApJ, 690,

In the  acquisition image the center  of the host is  0.7"" offset with

We performed the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis
of GRB 090516A (Swift/BAT trigger #352190: Rowlinson et al., GCN Circ. 
9374, Baumgartner et al. GCN Circ. 9384).  Since the Konus-Wind observed 
this GRB in the waiting mode, we only have 3 channel spectral data for 
the Konus-Wind which cover the energy range from 20 keV to 1.2 MeV.  The 
joint spectral analysis of the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data 
allows us to derive the broad-band spectral parameters of this burst.

The time interval of the spectral data for each instrument is chosen
from T0(BAT)-12.2 to T0(BAT)+96.7 sec where T0(BAT) is the trigger time
of BAT at 08:27:50.8 UTC.  The energy ranges which we used in the joint
spectral analysis are 20-1200 keV and 14-150 keV for the Konus-Wind and
the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of two instruments are
fitted with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to take
into account the systematic effective area uncertainties in the response
matrices of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law with exponential cutoff 
model: dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). The constant factors 
of each instrument agree within 10%.  No systematic residual from the 
best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  The 
best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = -1.5 (-0.3/+0.2) and Epeak 
= 190 (-65/+230) keV (chi2/dof = 54/56).  The best fit spectral 
parameters for the GRB (Band) model fixing beta = -2.5 are: 
alpha = -1.5 (-0.2/+0.3), and Epeak = 190 (-75/+270) keV (chi2/dof = 55/56).
The energy fluence in the 15-1200 keV band calculated by a power-law 
with exponential cutoff model for this 107.9 sec interval is 
(1.5 +/- 0.3)x10^-5 erg/cm2.

Assuming z = 4.109 (de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN Circ. 9383) and a standard 
cosmology model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27, Omega_Lambda = 
0.73, the isotropic energy release is E_iso = 6.5 (-1.1/+1.4) x10^53 erg in

090529 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 9430; Xin et al., GCN 9431) with the grism 
300V, covering the wavelength range 3500-9200 AA. In the acquisition 
image the afterglow has a magnitude of R ~ 22.60 +-0.05. The first spectrum 
was taken starting on May 31.0778 UT (1.48 days after the GRB).

In a preliminary analysis we detect strong absorption around 4416 AA
which we interpret as Lyman-alpha at a redshift of 
z = 2.63. This value is supported by the detection of several metal
absorption features, e.g., SiII 1526, CII 1335, SiII 1402 and CIV 1549, all
at the common z=2.625, which we interpret as the redshift of the GRB. 

We thank the Paranal staff for excellent support, in particular 
Thomas Szeifert, Alain Smette, and Karla Aubel. We are also grateful to Lipin Xin 
for providing us with a finding chart.

For GRB 090531B (Cummings et al. GCN 9461), the BAT team has
analyzed spectral lags for the data from T-1.0 sec to T+2.0 sec
using non-mask weighted light curves with 16 msec time binning.
The spectral lags were measured between standard canonical BAT
energy bands: channel 1 (15-25 keV), 2 (25-50 keV), 3 (50-100 keV)
and 4 (100-350 keV) are given below.

Lag Ch3-Ch2 : -2 +/- 9 msec
Lag Ch4-Ch2 : 11 +/- 5 msec
Lag Ch4-Ch3 :  8 +/- 3 msec

The signal-to-noise ratio in channel 1 is too weak to make a
lag measurement.

detect a number of strong absorption features that we identify as Mg II,
Mg I, and Fe II at a common redshift of z = 0.54.  We believe this likely

The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.4 to T+213.6 sec
is best fit by a power law with an exponential cutoff.
This fit gives a photon index 1.42 +/- 0.08,
and Epeak of 134 +/- 19 keV (chi squared 14.6
for 56 d.o.f.).  For this model the total fluence in
the 15-150 keV band is 1.05 +/- 0.01 x 10^-04 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+65.38 sec in
the 15-150 keV band is 38.8 +/- 0.8 ph/cm2/sec.
A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.72 +/- 0.02 (chi squared 55.8 for 57 d.o.f.).

We reduce the Swift XRT and BAT data using our automated pipeline (see,

#359711: Stamatikos et al., GCN Circ. 9768, Baumgartner et al. GCN Circ. 
9775) triggered Konus-Wind at T0(KW)=21758.942 s UT (06:02:38.942).
Since the Konus-Wind trigger record misses the early weaker part of this 
GRB, we have only Konus-Wind 3-channel spectral data for the whole burst 
which cover the energy range from 23 keV to 1.4 MeV.
We performed the Konus-Wind and Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis of
this GRB to derive the broad-band spectral and energetic parameters of
this burst.

The time interval of the spectral data is chosen from
T0(BAT)-6.7 to T0(BAT)+58.1 sec where T0(BAT) is the trigger time
of BAT at 06:02:08.897 UTC.  The energy ranges which we used in the
joint spectral analysis are 23-1400 keV and 15-150 keV for the
Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of two
instruments are fitted with the spectral model multiplied by the
constant factor to take into account the systematic effective area
uncertainties in the response matrices of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law with exponential cutoff
model: dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). The constant factors
of each instrument agree within 15%.  No systematic residual from the
best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  The
best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = -1.03(-0.06, +0.07) and Epeak
= 586(-152, +243) keV (chi2/dof = 59.3/57).  The best fit spectral
parameters for the GRB (Band) model fixing beta = -2.5 are:
alpha = -1.03 +/- 0.07, and Epeak = 572(-159, +251) keV (chi2/dof = 
59.6/57). The energy fluence in the 15-1400 keV band calculated by a 
power-law with exponential cutoff model for this 64.8 sec interval is 
(2.61 +/- 0.34)x10^-5 erg/cm2 (assuming the constant factor of the 
Konus-Wind is fixed to 1).

Assuming z = 2.452 (de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN Circ. 9771) and a
standard cosmology model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27,
Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the isotropic energy release is E_iso = 4.4 (-0.6,
+0.7)x10^53 erg in 1 keV to 10 MeV at the GRB rest frame extrapolating
the best Band function fit fixing beta = -2.5, and the rest frame peak 
energy is Epeak_rest = 2.0(-0.5, +0.9) MeV.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

We observed the afterglow of GRB 090926A (Bissaldi, GCN 9933; Uehara et 
al., GCN 9934; Vetere et al., GCN 9936; Haislip et al., GCN 9937) with 
the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO-VLT UT2. Observations were 
taken as part of the instrument Science Verification phase. X-shooter is 
a broad-band single-object spectrograph covering the wavelength range 
from the UV to the infrared (3300-22000 AA).

At the beginning of the observation (22.0 hr after the GRB), the 
afterglow had R = 17.9 as measured from the acquisition image. Four 
spectra lasting 1800 s each were secured.

The spectrum has high signal to noise and shows a wealth of absorption 
features, together with a broad depression around 3780 AA, which we 
interpret as a DLA. We identify CIV 1548 and 1550, Si II 1304 and 1526, 
SiII* 1533, FeII 1608, MgII 2798 and 2803, and several others, from 
which we measure a redshift z=2.1062. We caution that the wavelength 
solution is based on archival calibration data.

The combined spectrum shows an emission line, presumably
corresponding to [O II] 3727 at z = 1.24. At his redshift we
find several other absorption features, including Mg II, Fe II

Spectra of the optical transient associated with GRB 010222 (GCN # 959, 961)
have been obtained on 23.61 February UT by H. Ebeling, using the Echelle 
Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) on the Keck-II 10-m telescope.  Preliminary 
analysis shows the following:

We confirm the existence of 3 absorption systems reported earlier (GCN # 965,
974, 989), with improved heliocentric redshifts as follows:

(1) z_abs = 1.4768 +- 0.0002  (based on 22 metallic lines)
    This system, presumably associated with the host galaxy, appears to 
    have some kinematic substructure, possibly with two distinct systems at
    z_1 = 1.47667 +- 0.00005  and  z_2 = 1.47755 +- 0.00005, i.e., with a
    restframe velocity separation of 106 km/s, typical for internal motions
    in galaxies.  The equivalent widths of the lines are unusually strong
    in comparison to metallic line absorbers seen in the spectra of quasars,
    indicating a high column density of gas, probably consistent with a
    star-forming region environment.

(2) z_abs = 1.1561 +- 0.0001  (based on 9 metallic lines)

(3) z_abs = 0.9274 +- 0.0001  (based on 5 metallic lines)

Systems (2) and (3) are typical for the metallic line absorbers at 
comparable redshifts.  Detection of two such foreground systems is not 
unusual.  Further analysis of the data is in progress.

We have analysed 13 ks of Swift-XRT data for GRB 091020 (Racusin et
al., GCN Circ. 10048), from 87 s to 29.6 ks after the BAT trigger
(#373458). The data comprise 350 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with
the remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position
for this burst was given by Beardmore et al. (GCN. Circ 10050).

The light curve shows an initial steep decay with an index of 3.7 +/-0.6,
breaking at T+130 s to a shallower decay of slope 0.90 +/- 0.03, with a
small flare superimposed at T+190s. A further break to a decay slope of
1.39 +/- 0.1 is apparent at T+6.6 ks.

The WT mode spectrum, from 87 s to 434 s after the trigger, can be fit
by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 1.99 +/- 0.07. The
best-fitting absorption column is (6.08 +1.04 -0.99) x 10^21 cm^-2, at
a redshift of 1.71 (Xu et al., GCN Circ 10053), in addition to the
Galactic value of 1.4 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). The PC
mode spectrum from 436 s to 7.3 ks (with an exposure time of 3.5 ks)
has a photon index of (2.15 +0.12 -0.11) and a best-fitting intrinsic
absorption column of (5.1 +1.6 -1.5) x 10^21 cm^-2. The counts to
observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from
this spectrum is 3.4 x 10^-11 (4.4 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1.

If the light curve continues to decay at the same rate, the count rate
at T+24 hours will be 0.015 count s^-1, which corresponds to an

GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405), mounted at the 2.2m ESO/MPI 
telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chile), observed the field of GRB 
091109A (Oates et al., GCN #10138) simultaneously in the g'r'i'z'JHK bands.

Observations were done under clear sky conditions, starting on Nov 10 at 
00:07 UTC, 19.1 h after the burst and lasted for 1.8 hours.

In stacked images corresponding to a total integration time of 60 min in 
JHK and 75 min in g'r'i'z', we detect the optical afterglow (Oates et 
al., GCN #10138, Guidorzi et. al, GCN #10142) in the g'r'i'z' bands and 
obtain the following preliminary magnitudes and upper limits (all in the 
AB system):

g' = 24.5 +/- 0.1
r' = 23.6 +/- 0.1
i' = 23.4 +/- 0.1
z' = 23.3 +/- 0.2
J > 22.2
H > 21.8
K > 21.2

which were derived using the GROND zero points and 2MASS catalog field 
stars as reference. No correction has been made for the expected 
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.03 mag in the 
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).

Associating the blue g'-r' color with Lyman-alpha absorption in the host 
of the GRB, we obtain a photometric redshift of z = 3.5 +/- 0.4 assuming 
no intrinsic dust.

In addition, we triggered VLT/FORS2 spectroscopy, that started Nov 10 at 
02:23 UTC, 21.5 h post-burst. Two integrations of 1800 s each at a mean 
airmass of 2.1 were obtained using the 600RI grism that covers the 
wavelength range from 5300 to 8700 A.  In the low S/N spectrum we find a 
tentative ~60A EW broad absorption feature around a wavelength of 5700A. 
If associated with Lyman-alpha absorption, the corresponding redshift of 
~3.5 would be in agreement with the GROND photo-z.

We note, however, that all observations are also consistent with a host 
galaxy at a redshift of z ~ 0.44. Given the absence of information about 
a possible host galaxy contribution we cannot distinguish these two 
possibilities at this point.

GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405), the 7-channel imager mounted 
at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chile), started 
follow-up observations of GRB 091221 (Krimm et al. 2009, GCN 10283) on Dec 
22, at 01:27 UT (4.5 hrs after the burst).

For the suggested GRB afterglow (Zheng et al. 2009, GCN 10284; Holland et

following preliminary magnitudes (in the AB system):

Taking into account a Galactic reddening of E(B-V)=0.22 mag (Holland et 
al. 2009, GCN 10285), we estimate a photometric redshift of z<3.5. At 
present we cannot decide if the z'-band magnitude is indicating to a

in this band (where the source is very faint).",No Redshift,GRB 091221,2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chile),No Information

Miller, and C. R. Klein (UC Berkeley) report:

We conducted a deep optical imaging integration on the field of GRB 
100205A (Racusin et al., GCN 10361) using LRIS on the Keck I 10m 
telescope starting at 09:48 UT on 2010 Feb 7.  We integrated for a total 
exposure time of 4000 seconds in g-band and 3770 seconds in R-band 
simultaneously under clear skies but variable and generally poor seeing 
conditions (1.5 arcsec average).  The mid-point of the integration was 
at 10:28 UT.

We detect no source at the position of the putative infrared afterglow 
(Tanvir et al., GCN 10366).  Calibrating relative to USNOB1.0, we 
measure limiting magnitudes (3-sigma) of:

R > 26.7
g > 26.6

as measured at the afterglow location.  A faint source is marginally 
detected (<2 sigma) in R-band only at the northwestern edge of the XRT 
error circle (Evans et al., GCN 10367), not consistent with the position 
of the infrared afterglow.

We also stacked the R-band and g-band images together to create a 
white-light composite image.  There is no significant detection in this 
image, with an approximate limiting magnitude of White > 27 mag.

All properties of this GRB are consistent with it being at high redshift:

* Lack of optical detection starting at early times (e.g. Malesani et 
al., GCN 10362; Updike et al., GCN 10364; Cobb et al, GCN 10365)
* An apparently fading afterglow candidate detected only in H- and 
K-bands (Cucchiara et al., GCN 10374; Im et al., GCN 10398)
* Limited X-ray absorption: excess N_H(z=0) = 7(+6/-5) x 10^20 cm^-2 
(Starling and Racusin, GCN 10369), generally suggestive of higher 
redshift (Grupe et al. 2007, AJ 133:2216G) and inconsistent with the 
alternative hypothesis of a large extinction column at low redshift for 
typical values of A_V/N_H.
* Lack of host galaxy to deep limits (Perley et al. 2009, AJ 138:1690)

As mentioned by Cucchiara et al., the implied redshift of this GRB if 
the red H-K color is due to Lyman-alpha absorption would be z ~ 11-13. 
However, significant dust absorption at intermediate redshift (e.g., 
A_V~3 mag at z~4) is still generally consistent with the available data, 
and unfortunately the X-ray afterglow is too faint to impose meaningful 
constraints on extinction in the K-band during the Gemini observation.

were acquired in the R-band under clear sky conditions.

A co-add of the first 9 images (midpoint 04:35 UT) reveals a faint point 
source at the position reported by Morgan et al (GCN 10747).  The source 
is near the detection limit of the co-add and is not detected in 
individual images.

Photometry of the object relative to three nearby SDSS stars (converted 
to Rc via the Lupton transformation equation) gives the following magnitude:

R = 21.39 +/- 0.25    (t_mid = 2.46 hours)

We note that this is significantly fainter than expected from the 
preliminary JHK magnitudes of Morgan et al (GCN 10749).  The IR spectral 
index is relatively flat (beta~0.5), suggesting little host extinction. 
  Assuming no extinction in addition to the Galactic value, a direct 
power-law extrapolation of the JHK data to R-band over-predicts the 
observed flux by >2 magnitudes, strongly suggesting an R-band dropout 
and likely redshift of 4.6 < z < 6.0.  We note also that the X-ray

starburst or late type galaxies. In this interpretation, a photometric
redshift of z=0.67 (+0.34, -0.12) is indicated. We caution that the error
might be underestimated due to the missing photometric calibration in the
g'r'i'z' bands. We note, however, that at this redshift the absolute

We have analyzed 6162 s of XRT data for GRB 100704A (Grupe  et al.
GCN Circ. 10929), from 92 s to 18.5 ks  after the  BAT trigger.
The data comprise 317 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the
remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The X-ray light curve displays
a strong flare starting at about 140s and peaking at 190s after the
burst. As mentioned in GCN Circ. 10929, this flare coincides with a
flare seen in the BAT. The rest of the light curve can be  modeled
with a series of power-law decays. After the flare the afterglow
decays with a slope of 0.32 and breaks at about 1 ks after the burst
followed  by a decay slope of 0.76+/-0.06.

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.96 (+/-0.04). The
best-fitting absorption column is  3.23 (+/-0.14) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.0 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). With an excess absorption column density of 2.32 x 10^21 cm^-2
the NH-redshift relation by Grupe et al. (2007, AJ 133, 2216)
suggests a redshift z<3.0.
The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.6 (+/-0.3) and a
best-fitting absorption column of 3.1 (+0.9, -0.8) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.5 x 10^-11 (8.3 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1.

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.76, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.045 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.6 x
10^-12 (3.7 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1 and 0.027 counts s^-1 T+48h.

The  UVOT-enhanced position of the afterglow has already been reported
by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 10930).

of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 13 ks of XRT data for GRB 100901A (Immler et al., GCN 
Circ. 11159), from 128 s to 33.2 ks after the BAT trigger. The data 
comprise 448 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 9 s were taken 
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 
The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Osborne et al. (GCN. 
Circ 11167).

The first snapshot (data collected until ~620 s after the trigger) 
consists of a number of superimposed flares, with the main peak around 410 
s; this peak was also seen in the BAT data (Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 
11169). The light curve then shows a decaying trend with alpha = 0.74 +/- 
0.12, until around 12 ks, after which there is a small rebrightening, to a 
plateau level of around 0.3 count s^-1.

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed 
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.68 (+/-0.04). The best-fitting 
absorption column is 3.6 (+0.7, -0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2, at a redshift of 
1.408 (Chornock et al., GCN Circ 11164), in addition to the Galactic value 
of 7.1 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). The PC mode spectrum has a 
photon index of 2.19 (+/-0.07) and a best-fitting absorption column of 3.9 
(+/-0.9) x 10^21 cm^-2 (in addition to the Galactic vale). The counts to 
observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this 
spectrum is 3.5 x 10^-11 (5.1 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1.

Because of the rebrightening/plateau shape of the light curve at this time, we 
cannot sensibly predict the count rate at 24 hours.

The light curve comprises a number of flares (at ~T0+145 s, T0+175 s to
T0+275 s, T0+615 s) followed by a power-law decay. The late-time light
curve (from T0+5.1 ks) can be modelled with  a power-law decay with a
decay index of alpha=1.63 (+/-0.10).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.420 (+/-0.020). The
best-fitting absorption column is  4.2 (+/-0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 2.22, in addition to the Galactic value of 1.6 x 10^20

""We re-observed the localization of GRB 110328A with Gemini-N/NIRI
on 31 March 2011. Observations were taken in the K-band, and began
at 13:15UT, roughly 24 hours after our previous observation (Levan
et al. GCN 11846). We find that the IR source, coincident
with the X-ray (Osborne et al. GCN 11826) and radio (Zauderer et
al. GCN 11848) localisations has faded by 0.25 +/- 0.03 magnitudes
over this time frame. Hence we conclude that the IR light does
contain a substantial contribution from transient emission. We note
that the apparent brightening of the source in a few hours between the
observations of Morgan et al. (GCN 11845) and Gemini (GCN 11846),
coupled with the fading over the subsequent 24 hours, suggests that
the behaviour of the system is complex, and as in the X-ray, is not
simply modelled by either a rising, or decaying lightcurve.

The location of the source is consistent with the galaxy
observed in the optical with a measured redshift z=0.351,
(Levan et al. GCN 11833, Thoene et al. GCN 11834) hence
increasing the confidence in a true association.

In the acquisition images, 5 x 150 seconds in R filter, we find a faint
source, consistent with the candidate afterglow reported by Elliott et al

star 0722-0043411 (R=16.65). The detection of the afterglow in the R band
places a limit on the redshift of approximately z < 5.

We performed spectroscopy of this source, under poor seeing and high
airmass. We detect a faint continuum in the near-infrared arm over the
whole wavelength range, at low signal to noise.
In the visual arm data we detect a very faint continuum at the red end of
the wavelength range. No emission lines are detected. Because of the low
signal to noise we are not able to identify absorption features. The non-
detection of continuum emission below ~600 nm may be indicative of a
moderately high redshift for this burst, though alternatives, such as a
reddened spectrum (note that the X-ray afterglow shows considerable
absorption; Osborne et al. GCN 12986), can not be excluded at present.

observed spectroscopically with VLT/X-shooter, starting on 2012 March

seconds was secured, which ran well into morning twilight. The
approximate X-shooter wavelength range is 0.3-2.5 micron. The seeing
during the observations was about 0.8"" in the optical, and the
spectrum has a resulting resolving power of 5000 in the ultraviolet
and near-infrared arms, and around 9000 in the optical.

The reduced spectrum shows a very weak continuum in all three
arms. The very low signal-to-noise ratio prevents us from identifying
any significant absorption or emission lines.  From the detection of
continuum flux down to roughly 3700 Angstrom we set an upper limit to

initial decay index is alpha=2.15 (+0.18, -0.17). At T+544 s  the decay
flattens to an alpha of 0.1 (+0.4, -0.6) before breaking again at
T+2930 s to a final decay with index alpha=1.83 (+0.21, -0.19).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.72 (+0.14, -0.13). The
best-fitting absorption column is  2.3 (+4.7, -2.3) x 10^21 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 2.87, in addition to the Galactic value of 3.4 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index
of 1.90 (+/-0.12) and a best-fitting absorption column of 4.5 (+4.3,
-4.0) x 10^21 cm^-2. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV
flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.7 x 10^-11 (4.3
x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Galactic foreground: 3.4 x 10^20 cm^-2
Intrinsic column:    4.5 (+4.3, -4.0) x 10^21 cm^-2 at z=2.87
Photon index:	     1.90 (+/-0.12)

team:

We observed the field of GRB 120909A (Swift trigger 533060; Immler et al.,
GCN #13727) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008,
PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla
Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 01:44 UT, September 09, 140s after the burst, and
are continuing. They were performed at an average seeing of 1"".6 and at an
average airmass of 1.2 .

We found a single point source within the 4"".8 Swift-XRT error circle
reported by Immler et al. (GCN #13727) at

RA (J2000.0) = 18h 22m 56.72s

DEC (J2000.0) = -59d 26' 54"".1

with an uncertainty of 0"".5 in each coordinate, which is consistent with
the position reported by Haislip et al. (GCN #13728)   .

Based on the first 141s of total exposures in g'r'i'z' and 240s in JHK,
we estimate preliminary magnitudes (all in AB) of

g' = 18.4 +- 0.1,
r' = 16.6 +- 0.1,
i' = 15.8 +- 0.1,
z' = 15.5 +- 0.1,
J = 14.8 +- 0.1,
H = 14.5 +- 0.1, and
K = 14.3 +- 0.1.

Based on the the significantly lower flux in g', this suggests a 
redshift z>3.

Given magnitudes are calibrated against GROND zeropoints as well as 2MASS
field stars and are not corrected for the expected Galactic foreground
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V)=0.08 mag in the

behalf of the GROND team:

Following two days of bad weather delay, we observed the field of GRB
121027A (Evans et al., GCN 13906) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND
(Greiner et al. 2008, PASP, 120, 405) mounted on the 2.2 m MPG/ESO
telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chile).

Observations began at 08:10 on October 29th (mid-time ~2.05 days
post-trigger). They were performed at an average seeing of 1.6"" (r'-band)
and at an average airmass of 1.2.

We detect the NIR afterglow reported by Starling et al. (GCN 13911) and
Levan et al. (GCN 13920) in all seven bands.

Based on a 460 sec integration in g'r'i'z' and 1200 sec integration in
JHK, we measure preliminary magnitudes (all in AB system) of

g' = 22.1 +/- 0.2 mag
r' = 21.6 +/- 0.1 mag
i' = 21.3 +/- 0.1 mag
z' = 20.9 +/- 0.1 mag
J  = 20.4 +/- 0.1 mag
H  = 19.7 +/- 0.1 mag
K  = 19.0 +/- 0.1 mag

We note an increase of brightness by ~ 1 magnitude relative to the
observations reported by Levan et al. (GCN 13920) at 32 hours after the
GRB.

Our detection in all bands constrains the redshift of this burst to z < 3.5.

Given magnitudes are calibrated against GROND zeropoints in the optical,
and 2MASS field stars in the NIR, and are not corrected for the expected
Galactic foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) =
0.02 mag in the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).",z < 3.5,GRB 121027A,2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope,Photometric

Kruehler (DARK) report:

We observed the position of GRB 121209A with the Low Resolution Imaging 
Spectrograph (LRIS) on Keck I on the night of UT December 11.  We 
acquired two 900-second spectra of the GROND afterglow candidate 
(Kruehler et al., GCN 14049) at a mean UT of 05:15 (1.30 day after the 
burst) followed by single exposure each of U- and I-band imaging at a 
mean UT of 06:33 (1.36 day after the burst).  The observations were 
affected by clouds and poor seeing, especially the imaging epoch.

We detect a source at the position of the GROND object in the I-band 
imaging frame.  Performing photometry relative to SDSS stars, we measure 
a magnitude of

I = 23.2 +/- 0.2 mag  (I=23.6 AB)

Which is consistent with the magnitude at 2.4 hours after the burst 
reported by Kruehler et al.  The lack of fading over this time range 
suggests that the source is not a GRB afterglow.  However, it may be the 
event's host galaxy.   Given the bright X-ray afterglow concurrent with 
the lack of an optical/IR counterpart in PAIRITEL, Gemini GROND and 
RATIR observations (GCNs 14047, 14048, 14049, 14050), GRB 121209A is 
""dark"" burst (beta_OX ~< 0, taking the GROND host magnitudes as upper 
limits).

Preliminary analysis of our 2D spectra shows no evidence of line 
emission across the spectral range (effectively continuous from the 
atmospheric cutoff to 10300 Angstroms), despite detection of a (weak) 
continuum trace down to approximately 10000 Angstroms.  If this is a 
star-forming galaxy, this absence of lines (in particular, from OII) 
would suggest a moderately high redshift (z>~1.7).  Deeper spectroscopy 
and in particular infrared observations would be needed to confirm this 
hypothesis.  If this is a distant galaxy, its apparent optical 
brightness indicates that it quite luminous.",No Redshift,GRB 121209A,Keck I,Spectroscopic

We have observed the optical counterpart of GRB 130215A (D'Elia et al., 
GCN 14204, Zheng et al., GCN 14205) with the 10.4 m GTC telescope 
equipped with the OSIRIS imager and spectrograph. A spectroscopic 
observation was performed on 12 March 2013 at a mean time of 20:52 UT, 
25.8 days after the burst, corresponding to 16.2 days after the burst in the 
rest frame, considering a redshift of z=0.597 (Cucchiara et al. GCN 14207). 
The total exposure was 3x1200s using a low resolution grating (R~600) 
covering a wavelength range 5000-10000 A. Due to its current location, 
observations had to be carried out at high airmass, between 1.6 and 2.2. 
There were thin cirrus but seeing was very good, at 0.6"".

At this epoch, the spectrum presents undulations typical of SN spectra, 
including a prominent bump at ~8200 A. Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, 
ApJ, 666, 1024), we have compared the spectrum to a series of SN templates. 
The spectrum gives a good match to a number of SNe Ic, including 
broad-lined and normal events such as SN 2002ap and SN 1994I, around 
maximum light or slightly after. By leaving the redshift unconstrained we 
obtain the same template fit and derive a redshift of z=0.58+/-0.02, fully 
consistent with the absorption line redshift.

Using several nearby USNO-B1 stars we estimated i' = 19.81

which is 0.43 mag fainter than the RATIR observations. 

We also obtained a 2x900s spectra of these two sources under cloudy
conditions, covering the 6000-10000A wavelength range: source #1
presents several stellar features, while source #2 presents a noisy 
continuum, but no clear absorption features are identified.

If we assume that source #2 is indeed GRB 130327A afterglow, we can
place an upper limit on the GRB redshift of z < 3.9, based on the 
absence of a Lyman-break features.

the CTIO 4m Blanco telescope and Mosaic II imager starting at 020813
04:34 UT (110 minutes after the burst) and continuing for an hour.  We
obtained a total of ten 300 second images, four in B band and three
each in R and I bands.  The weather was good with subarcsecond seeing.

Preliminary analysis of the first image (a B band frame) confirms the
transient reported by Price et al (GCNC 1470).  Astrometric calibration
using 759 USNO-A2 stars brighter than R=16 places this image on a world
coordinate system.  We find coordinates of
 19:46:41.865 -19:36:04.76  (J2000.0) for the optical transient, with
an estimated error of 0.3"" on each axis based on the 0.28"" RMS residuals
of the USNO star positions.

Crude photometric calibration using the blue USNO-A2 magnitudes
of three nearby stars gives B=18.6 at 04:36 UT.
This B band detection immediately implies an upper limit z < 3.8

We imaged the field of GRB 130606A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 14781) with the 
robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope throughout the night of 2013-06-07 UT, 
beginning at 04:01 UT and continuing until morning twilight at 11:39 UT. 
  Initial observations consisted of a series of r, i, and z-band frames; 
later in the night we switched to exclusively z-band observations. 
Transparency and seeing conditions were good throughout.

The GRB afterglow (Jelinek et al., GCN 14782; Xu et al., GCN 14783; 
Nagayama et al., GCN 14784) is well-detected in the z-band exposures and 
marginally detected in the other filters.  Preliminary (not

The afterglow decays as a power-law with an index of approximately 
alpha=1.6-1.7 over the course of the observations.

Given the redshift (Castro-Tirado et al., GCN 14796; Lunnan et al., GCN

We detect a fading afterglow in the z' band in most individual

We have analysed 11 ks of XRT data for GRB 130612A (Racusin  et al. GCN
Circ. 14874),  from 74 s to 30.7 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 233 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 9 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Beardmore
et al. (GCN. Circ 14884).

The light curve can be modelled with  a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.96 (+0.09, -0.08).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.19 (+0.28, -0.26). The
best-fitting absorption column is  7.7 (+6.6, -5.5) x 10^21 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 2.006, in addition to the Galactic value of 6.0 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). The counts to observed (unabsorbed)
0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.3 x
10^-11 (4.7 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Galactic foreground: 6.0 x 10^20 cm^-2
Intrinsic column:    7.7 (+6.6, -5.5) x 10^21 cm^-2 at z=2.006
Photon index:	     2.19 (+0.28, -0.26)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.96, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 1.8 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 6.1 x
10^-14 (8.7 x 10^-14) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

An X-ray source is detected at a position consistent with the optical afterglow

with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 695 arcsec from the Fermi/LAT position and 4 arcsec

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with an
index of alpha=1.6 (+/-0.7). 

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed

	-------------------------------------------

This spectrum was taken in five 1200 s exposures from Oct 8 10:14-14:05 UT.
In view of the 6 Angstrom resolution of this spectrum, we consider that the
lowest redshift absorber of the three is a blend of two of the four systems that
were seen by Salamanca et al. (GCN #1611) in higher resolution data.  Also, we
detect one absorption line (Al II 1670) at the same redshift as the Ly alpha
emission, z=2.328, which we therefore designate the redshift of the host galaxy.
The detection of this lone low-ionization absorber is plausible because of its large 
oscillator strength, f=1.83.  Thus, all of the high-ionization absorbers are 
blueshifted from the host redshift, by up to 3,200 km/s.
   
The decay curve shows significant deviations from a power law, which might be
understood in terms of inhomogeneities in the ambient medium in which the afterglow 
expands.  In view of the revised redshift of 2.328 and the multiple blueshifted
H, C IV, and Si IV absorption lines, we hypothesize that the velocity span of
3,200 km/s in these components is indicative of a clumpy wind from a massive hot star
progenitor, such as a Wolf-Rayet star.  This would avoid the difficulties of scenarios 
involving supernova ejecta or cosmic clustering, as explained in GCN #1611.  The absence
of nitrogen lines and the presence of Ly alpha and Si IV weaker than C IV is consistent
with a WC star, in which the bulk of the wind is approximately equal parts He and C.

We assume a typical mass-loss rate of 10(-5) Msun/yr and a wind terminal velocity 
of 3,000 km/s.  Following Chevalier & Li (2000, ApJ, 536, 195), the predicted radius 
r_s of a spherical adiabatic blast wave in such a stellar wind at an observed time of
1 day is 3.5x10(17) cm for an isotropic energy of 5.6x10(52) erg (Malesani et al.,
GCN #1607), or 3.5x10(16) cm if there is a beaming correction of 1/100 to the energy.  
Chosing the larger value of r_s, the column density of C in the wind is at least
3.6x10(15) cm(-2) between the shock and the deceleration radius of the wind, which
is of order 5x10(17) cm or greater (Ramirez-Ruiz et al. 2000, MNRAS, 327, 829).  This
would be enough to account for the observed absorption at high velocities.  We note that 
for a typical nu(-1) broad-band spectrum, C IV ions in the wind would absorb in the line 
before being photoionized.  Detailed photoionization models are needed to predict the 
evolution of the column densities.  A consequence of this model is that the high-velocity 
components of C IV should decline after being photoionized, or as the shock overruns the 
wind in several days.  Continued spectroscopic monitoring of this bright afterglow is
urged in order to search for this definitive signature of the massive star progenitor of 
GRBs.  Changes in the decay curve could also result when the afterglow reaches the 
termination of the stellar wind with the ISM.""",2.328,GRB 021004,MDM 1.3m,Spectroscopic

Observations started at 00:43 UT on 2014-04-29, 2 hours after the GRB

average airmass of 1.9.

We found a single point source within the 1.7"" Swift-XRT error circle

This source is consistent with the one reported by Perley (GCN #16180).

Based on the first 1133 s of total exposures in g'r'i'z' and 1920 s in

z' = 21.5 +/- 0.1 mag,

From our data, fading can not be established. We note that our r'-band 
magnitude is similar to that reported by Perley (GCN #16180) at a mid-time
of 7.5 hrs after the GRB.

The spectral energy distribution is best-fit by a straight power-law  and
a sharp cut-off below
the i'-band which cannot be modelled with extinction alone. If this is the
GRB afterglow, the cut-off corresponds to a photometric redshift of z =
4.8 +-0.3, consistent with the Keck spectroscopy

We have analysed 7.1 ks of XRT data for GRB 140515A (D'Avanzo  et al.

data comprise 9 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (taken while Swift was
slewing), with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced
XRT position for this burst was given by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 16270).


The light curve can be modelled with  a power-law decay with an initial
decay index of alpha=2.5 (+0.5, -0.3). Then at T0+1100 s the light
curve rises, reaching a count rate ~ 0.3 ct/sec. The remaining two
orbits show irregular rate variations likely due to an underlying
flaring activity, with a count rate ~ 0.3 ct/sec and ~ 0.1 ct/sec
respectively.

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.75 (+0.12, -0.11). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.7 (+3.2, -1.7) x 10^22 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 6.32 (Chornock et al., GCN Circ. 16269), in addition to the
Galactic value of 2.5 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.7 x 10^-11 (3.9 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2

The late-time light curve (from T0+3.8 ks) can be modelled with a

We have analysed 5.5 ks of XRT data for GRB 161014A (Racusin et al. GCN
Circ. 20035), from 108 s to 34.8 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 48 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 7 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. Using 5612 s of PC mode data and 8 UVOT images, we find an
enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT
field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 332.64760, +7.46873
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 22h 10m 35.42s
Dec(J2000): +07d 28' 07.4""

with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The light curve can be modelled with an initial power-law decay with an
index of alpha=0.45 (+/-0.12), followed by a break at T+1757 s to an
alpha of 1.59 (+0.14, -0.13).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.83 (+0.11, -0.10). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.5 (+0.9, -0.8) x 10^22 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 2.823, in addition to the Galactic value of 7.5 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed)
0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.7 x
10^-11 (4.5 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Galactic foreground: 7.5 x 10^20 cm^-2

al. (GCN #1999), Martini et al. (GCN #2012) and from the SSO 40-inch
(GCN #1987) yeilds the following decay:

	R/mag ~ 15.8 + 2.4 log (t/days)

with corresponding power-law index alpha = 0.97 +/- 0.03.
Hence, though the afterglow is bright, the decay is not unusually
shallow (eg, 010222 had alpha1 ~ 0.80).

The spectral index, calculated from the B-I colour from Burenin et
al. (GCN #2001) and Rumyantsev et al. (GCN #2005) is beta ~ 1.2.

Using the measured redshift (Martini et al., GCN #2013; Della Ceca et al.,
GCN #2015), optical decay and spectral index, we calculate the R-band
absolute magnitude of the optical afterglow for t=1 day in the source
frame, M_R,1 = -26.7 mag.  This is therefore the most intrinsically bright
optical afterglow observed to date (with 000301C and 000418 tied for
second at M_R,1 = -26.1 mag).  The low redshift and the large intrinsic
brightness combined to produce an optical afterglow with a large apparent
brightness.

The redshift of z=0.57 and measured fluence (Vanderspek et al., GCN #1997)
implies an isotropic-equivalent energy release of 1.1 x 10^53 erg (30-400
keV).  The Frail et al. ""standard energy"" result implies a jet-break time
of around 4 days.  At this time, the afterglow should be R ~ 17.3 mag.
We encourage polarimetric observations to be made on this timescale to
constrain the jet dynamics.

We have analysed 6.7 ks of XRT data for GRB 170202A (Racusin et al. GCN

comprise 131 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 7 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Osborne et
al. (GCN Circ. 20586).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=2.9 (+3.3, -0.6). At T+84.5 s  the decay
flattens to an alpha of -1.5 (+0.0, -2.0). The light curve breaks again
at T+95.5 s to a decay with alpha=3.15 (+0.19, -0.17),	and  again at
T+314 s s to alpha=0.01 (+0.17, -0.18),  before a final break at T+2223
s s after which the decay index is 1.08 (+0.12, -0.17).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.94 (+0.09, -0.08). The
best-fitting absorption column is  3.7 (+6.4, -3.7) x 10^21 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 3.645, in addition to the Galactic value of 2.0 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index
of 2.00 (+0.13, -0.12) and a best-fitting absorption column of 5.2
(+8.8, -5.2) x 10^21 cm^-2. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10
keV flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.2 x 10^-11

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of

S. G. Djorgovski, S. R. Kulkarni, J. S. Bloom, S. C. Odewahn, R. R. Gal 
(CIT), and D. A. Frail (NRAO) note on behalf of the Caltech-CARA-NRAO 
collaboration:

The lower limit to redshift of GRB 990123 (Kelson et al., IAUC, 7096), 
z =< 1.61, implies a luminosity distance D >= 3.73e28 cm, assuming a
standard Friedmann cosmology with H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_0 = 0.2, and
Lambda_0 = 0 (larger if Lambda_0 > 0).

Assuming the gamma-ray fluence reported by Feroci et al. (IAUC 7095), the
implied isotropic gamma-ray energy of this burst would be > 2.3e54 erg,
higher than most (or all) currently viable theoretical models can easily
accomodate.  The absolute magnitude of the optical counterpart at maximum 
light (Akerlof and McKay, GCN Circ. 205) would be M =< -36.5, i.e.,
> 2e16 L_sun, a remarkable number itself.

The apparent host galaxy of this burst, coincident with the optical
transient (Odewahn et al., GCN Circ. 201 and IAUC 7094) detected on DPOSS
(digital POSS-II) images calibrated with new CCD photometry in the field,
has a Gunn r magnitude 21.9 +- 0.4, i.e., R ~ 21.5 +- 0.5 (cf. Gal et al.,
GCN Circ. 213).  Its probable redshift is likely to be approximately 0.2 to
0.3, and (unless an active nucleus is present, for which there is no
spectroscopic evidence so far) almost certainly not at z = 1.61, the 
absorption line redshift measured by Kelson et al.

We therefore suggest that this may be the first documented case of a 
gravitationally lensed GRB, magnified by at least an order of magnitude by 
a foreground galaxy detected in DPOSS (possibly including some microlensing).  
This hypothesis naturally accounts for all of the data so far: the large 
fluence of the burst, its enormous implied gamma-ray luminosity, its 
remarkably high peak optical brightness and implied luminosity (and makes 
it consistent with previous non-detections of other bursts by the ROTSE and 
LOTIS experiments, with m_lim ~ 14), and the presence of an apparent 
foreground galaxy positionally coincident with the optical transient.

The conclusive test of this hypothesis will be a direct measurement of the 
galaxy's redshift, once the OT fades sufficiently.  If microlensing is
involved, a signature may be seen in the shape of the OT light curve.
Possible image splitting may be detectable, and high-resolution imaging
in radio, near-IR, and optical is urged.

In any case, the early detection by the ROTSE team (GCN Circ. 205), even if
corrected for a putative large gravitational lensing magnification factor,
suggests that routine early detections of GRBs in the visible light are
within reach, perhaps at ~ 15 mag level.

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 180510B (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 
22696; Schady et al., GCN 22701) with the ESO VLT/X-shooter 
spectrograph, covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA.
The afterglow is clearly detected in the 10s acquisition images taken 
starting at 23:09 UT (~3.7 hours after the GRB trigger) with brightness 
R~19.8 (Vega), calibrated against USNO-B1 stars in the field. 
Spectroscopy started at 23:19 UT on 2018-05-10 (~3.9 hours after the GRB 
trigger) and consisted of 2 exposures of 600 s.

Preliminary analysis of the spectrum reveals continuum flux down to 3600 
AA, which sets an upper limit to the redshift z <~ 2 via the lack of any 
obvious DLA feature. In addition, we identify several absorption lines 
at a common redshift of z=1.305, the most prominent being ZnII/CrII, 
FeII, MgII, and MgI. Moreover, we also identify another absorption 
system at z=0.63 based on the detection of the MgII doublet. Therefore, 
we propose the most probable redshift of the GRB to be z=1.305, with an 
intervening system at 0.638.

The emission is seen up to 0.8 MeV.

Observations started at 04:42 UT on 2018-06-25, 14.9 hrs after the GRB

Spectroscopy was secured: we obtained 4x900s exposures using grism 4 (with a wavelength coverage from 350 to 900 nm) starting at 23:27:14 UT on December 13 (i.e. 10.5 hr after trigger). The observations were obtained at a seeing around 1 but at an airmass > 3. From the acquisition image taken without filter we measure r = 20.6 +/- 0.2 AB mag, calibrated against SDSS r-band Pan-STARRS local photometry. The combined spectrum shows a low-S/N, mostly featureless continuum.

Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U. Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U.

We have analysed 6.8 ks of XRT data for GRB 190114A (LaPorte et al. GCN
Circ. 23677), from 235 s to 19.0 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 64 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 9 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Evans et
al. (GCN Circ. 23679).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=7.87 (+0.13, -0.43). At T+403 s  the decay
flattens to an alpha of 0.01 (+0.20, -0.17) before breaking again at
T+2398 s to a final decay with index alpha=1.16 (+/-0.14).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 2.38 (+0.17, -0.12). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1 (+13, -1) x 10^21 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 3.3765, in addition to the Galactic value of 1.6 x 10^21
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index
of 1.80 (+0.09, -0.08) and a best-fitting absorption column of 2 (+10,
-2) x 10^21 cm^-2. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux
conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.9 x 10^-11 (4.8 x
10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Galactic foreground: 1.6 x 10^21 cm^-2
Intrinsic column:    2 (+10, -2) x 10^21 cm^-2 at z=3.3765
Photon index:	     1.80 (+0.09, -0.08)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.16, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.013 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 5.0 x
10^-13 (6.2 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 190114C (Gropp et al., GCN

with the ESO-VLT UT2 (Kueyen) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph, 
covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA. We acquired four 600 second 
spectra on 2019-01-15 between 01:42UT and 02:32UT, approximately 4.75 
hours after the GRB. In the acquisition image we measure r' = 18.2 +/- 
0.4 (AB), calibrated against several nearby Pan-STARRS comparison stars.

We detect several strong absorption features, namely Ca H&K, Na ID, Mg 
II and Mg I, at a common redshift z = 0.4250, consistent with the values 
reported by Selsing et al. (GCN #23695) and Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN

Furthermore, the spectrum shows OII, Hbeta, OIII and Halpha in emission 
at the same redshift, fully confirming it.

The line-of-sight is highly extinguished, which is in agreement with the 
large column density seen in Swift XRT observations (Evans et al., GCN

The extremely bright, short-duration, hard-spectrum
GRB 190206A (IPN triangulation: Svinkin et al., GCN Circ. 23879)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=13763.926 s UT (03:49:23.926).

The burst light curve shows a single smooth pulse
which starts at ~T0 s and has a total duration of ~0.1 s.
There is no evidence of an extended emission following the burst.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.64(-0.17,+0.17)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.004 s,
of 6.44(-0.75,+0.76)x10^-4 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+0.064 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with  alpha = -0.58(-0.10,+0.12)
and Ep = 1600(-223,+248) keV (chi2 = 31/30 dof).
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index: beta < -2.3
(chi2 = 30/29 dof).

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB190206_T13763/

The spectrum of the burst is typical of short-hard GRBs.
Assuming the measured fluxes, GRB 190206A is the third-brightest
short GRB detected by KW since November, 1994 in terms of peak flux,
and among the dozen brightest short GRBs, in terms of the fluence
(Svinkin et al. 2016, ApJS 224 10).

Although the redshift of GRB 190206A is not available (yet),
a comparison of the provisional track of the burst in the Ep,z-Eiso
and Ep,z-Liso planes with the KW sample of GRBs with known redshifts
(Tsvetkova et al., 2017, ApJ 850 161) suggests z < 0.5

Assuming that the new, bright source that Zerbi et al. (GCN 2466) have
identified in H and Ks in the very small (<6"") S1 XMM-Newton error circle
(Santos-Lleo & Calderon, GCN 2464) is indeed the afterglow of GRB 031203
(Gotz et al., GCN 2459), the deep limits that Bailyn et al. (GCN 2468)
measure at the location of this source in I and J do indeed imply a sharp
spectral break between the H and J bands:  J - H > 5 mag and H - Ks ~ 1 mag
when corrected for Galactic extinction (Bailyn et al., GCN 2468).

Although one explanation for this dropout signature might be that GRB
031203 is at redshift z ~ 10, this is difficult to reconcile with the
brightness of the afterglow (Price, private communication), which is
probably in the top 10% of all afterglows.

Nor can so sharp a spectral break be explained by extinction by regular
dust, whether Galactic or in the source frame.

However, the dust along the line of sight, at least within hundreds of
parsecs of the GRB, should *not* be regular.  Although dust within parsecs
to tens of parsecs of the GRB will be returned to the gas phase by
sublimation, dust at greater distances -- out to hundreds of parsecs --
will be repeatedly fragmented by grain charging and Coulomb explosions
(Waxman & Draine 2000, Fruchter, Krolik & Rhoads 2001, Reichart 2001).

If most of the dust fragments down to PAH sizes, its visual absorption edge
-- which can be quite sharp -- will shift to the source-frame R or I band
(the exact wavelength depends on the size of the grains; Li & Draine 2001).
Longer-wavelength light will pass through this dust as if were not even
there.

For a GRB at a typical redshift of z ~ 1, this visual absorption edge will
be redshifted to between the J and H bands.  Such a redshift would also be
easier to reconcile with the brightness of the GRB 031203 afterglow in the
H and Ks bands.

So actually, every highly extinguished, low- to moderate-redshift GRB
afterglow might look like this in the NIR.

For GRB 031203, this hypothesis can be tested by (1) pursuing NIR
spectroscopy tonight while the afterglow is still sufficiently bright, but
be warned that if at z ~ 1 H-alpha might be blueward of the spectral break,
and/or (2) pursuing deep imaging blueward of the spectral break in hopes of
identifying a typical-redshift host galaxy, but again be warned:  since the
Galactic A_V ~ 3 mag and possibly more along this line of sight, J, z, and
I bands are preferred.

The Follow-Up Network for Gamma-Ray Bursts (a.k.a. the FUN GRB
Collaboration), the resources of which are currently concentrated more in
the northern hemisphere, will not be able to pursue either of these
observing strategies tonight.",z ~ 10,GRB 031203,XMM-Newton,Photometric

We obtained Liverpool Telescope IO:O imaging observations of

candidate counterpart to S190901ap but recently shown (Burdge et al.,

20:35, followed by a griz sequence (3x150s per filter) between 22:33 and
23:08.

The transient is well-detected in all four bands, but has faded
substantially since the ZTF discovery epoch (see also Wei et al., GCN
15640).  We report the following photometry (times given as UT midpoints):

103) the SED is well-fit by to a power-law in frequency with spectral
index (F_nu ~ nu^beta) of beta ~ -1.4.

As noted in GCN 25616, this field was imaged by ZTF every night during
the 30 days prior to the ZTF discovery.  No source was detected in any
of these observations, with the most recent nondetection corresponding
to 2019-09-01 UT 07:35, 0.86 days prior to the ZTF discovery observation.

The fast rise, red power-law spectrum, and fast decline are consistent
with observations of known GRB optical afterglows.  However, we searched
the Fermi GBM subthreshold GRB catalog over the window between the last
ZTF detection and the discovery observation and found no GRB consistent
with the location of the transient over time window.

Further observations, including multiwavelength observations, have been
requested.

TESS observed the location of the optical transient ZTF19abvizsw (Kool et al. 2019, GCN 25616) and associated new X-ray source (Ho et al. 2019, GCN 25658) nearly continuously during Sector 15 from 2019-08-15 to 2019-09-10 in Camera 2, CCD 2.  The location was imaged in nearly 2400 30-minute full-frame images (FFIs) over that period.

A light curve for ZTF19abvizsw was constructed from the FFIs using difference imaging.  First, we constructed a reference image by median stacking 20 FFIs with low background levels.  We then subtracted the reference image from each epoch using the ISIS software (Alard & Lupton 1998; Alard 2000), which solves for a spatially variable kernel that matches the PSF of the reference image to individual FFIs.  This procedure removes systematic errors due to pointing shifts/jitter and thermal variations.  We extracted a light curve by fitting a model of the PSF to the difference images at the predicted location of the transient in the FFIs based on the coordinates of ZTF19abvizsw reported to the Transient Name Server, and subtracted a local background based on the median of pixel values in an annulus of inner/outer radius 8/12 pixels.  Uncertainties were estimated from the photon noise of the source and the observed scatter of the light curve at early times.

We flux-calibrated the differential light curve by shifting the baseline before the transient to zero.  We estimated the 3-sigma TESS limiting magnitude at each epoch by taking a factor of 3 times the flux uncertainty at each epoch and converting to TESS magnitudes (the TESS passband spans 600-1000 nm). The average 3-sigma limiting magnitude during the time of the transient is 19.11 and is dominated by the background flux in each FFI.  

ZTF19abvizsw was seen to brighten above the limiting magnitude in the FFI centered at UT 2019-09-02 03:15 - - one hour before the ZTF measurement at 2019-09-02 04:19:12 (https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2019pim <https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2019pim>) - - and peak at a TESS magnitude of 18.37 +/- 0.18 at in the FFI centered at UT 2019-09-02 04:15.  The discrepancy between this measurement and the ZTF r-band magnitude of 19.45 may be due to the redness of the source (Kool et al. 2019, GCN 25616) or brightness variations within the 30-minute FFI integration.

The light curve has a sharp rise and a slower decline.  The duration (T90) of the transient over the background limit is 1.44 days, and the integrated S/N of the transient was 10.4.  We also fit a fast rise/exponential decay model to the light curve, from which we estimate the rise time to be 1.21 +/- 0.30 hours.  The fit yields a peak magnitude of 18.40 +/- 0.07 at 2019-09-02 04:19:29.  This is in family with the measured early brightness of optical counterparts of GRBs with redshifts near the measured redshift of ZTF19abvizsw of 1.26 (Levan et al. 2019, GCN 25653).

The differenced image is seen at approximately RA=18:37:53.57, Dec=+61:29:55.58, with an estimated error of 3 arcseconds, based on the flux-weighted centroid.  This position is in excellent agreement with the discovery coordinates of ZTF19abvizsw.",1.26,ZTF19abvizsw,TESS,Spectroscopic

Guido Chincarini, on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

We performed both NIR and optical observations of the field of GRB 
040827 (Mereghetti et al., GCNs 2670, 2672) with the ESO-VLT. NIR 
observations were performed on Aug 27.96 and 28.96 (11 and 35 hrs after 
the GRB respectively).

We confirm the variability of source XMM2 (Gladders & Berger, GCN 2681; 
Kaplan & Berger, GCN 2683; Tanvir et al., GCN 2684), which fades by 0.7 
+- 0.2 mag in the K filter. During both observations the seeing was 
similar (0.9"" and 1.0""), therefore even if the source is extended (thus 
making photometry more tricky) this variability is a real effect. JHK 
colors of the object (on Aug 27) are consistent with a power law 
spectral shape, with a spectral index beta ~ 1.4. Note however that a 
significant contribution from the host may be present in our measurements.

Given the variability of XMM2 and its spatial coincidence with the X-ray 
source detected by XMM (Rodriguez-Pascual & Juarez, GCN 2678; see also 
http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/external/xmm_news/items/grb040827/index.shtml 
for a refined position), we also conclude that XMM2 is likely the 
afterglow of GRB 040827 (Kaplan & Berger, GCN 2683; Tanvir et al., GCN 
2684).

I-band observations were performed on Aug 28.99 and Aug 30.01. No 
significant variation is seen between the two epochs (at the ~0.2 mag 
level). The source has I ~ 22.6 in both nights. This suggests that the 
emission is dominated by the host galaxy at these epochs, therefore 
implying a very weak afterglow. Otherwise, the decay may have 
experienced a plateaux phase.

A spectrum taken with the VLT on Aug 30.00) shows a weak featureless 
continuum in the range 4600-8600 A. The lack of detection of any 
emission lines does not allow us to determine a redshift, but it can put 
some constraints on it. For example, the non-detection of [O III] 5006 A 
(usually prominent in GRB host galaxies spectra) would imply z > 0.7. 
The absence of Ly alpha emission also limits z < 2.7.

collaboration report:

""We have analysed the data XMM-Newton observation of GRB 040827 (Gotz et 
al.
GCN 2670). A preliminary account of these data has been given by
Rodriguez-Pascual & Gonzalez-Riestra (GCN 2688).

The observation started on 2004-08-27 at 18:07:56.UT, lasting 54.3 ks.
Thanks to quick-look data it was soon realised that an afterglow was 
present
but it was more than 1arcmin off the camera boresight. Therefore, the 
telescope
was re-pointed during the observation (causing problems in the generation
of the ancillary file for spectral analysis).

The source intensity profile is consistent within errors with the
instrumental PSF (possible earlier reports of an extended source might be
due to the re-pointing of the satellite).
Astrometry of the XMM-Newton/EPIC images was done by matching X-ray
sources in the field to stars in the USNO-B1 catalogue. The refined
position (J2000) for the X-ray afterglow (source XMMUJ151701.3-160828,
GCN 2678) is: RA(2000) 15h 17m 01.39s, Dec(2000):-16d 08' 28.77''.
The positional accuracy is at a level of 1.5'' (68% c.l.).
This position is consistent with earlier reports (Rodriguez-Pascual &
Gonzalez-Riestra GCN 2688, XMM-2) and with the position of the likely
afterglow established based on optical-NIR data (Berger et al. GCN 2680;
Gladders & Berger GCN 2681; Kaplan & Berger GCN 2683; Tanvir et al. GCN 
2684;
Malesani et al. GCN 2685).

We extracted spectra from the three EPIC cameras. We took the arf file
from the same region of extraction of a different observation.
A single absorbed power law model provides a good description of the data
(chi2_red=1.2 with 187 degrees of freedom), however the column density
(N_H=3.7_{-1.2}^{+4.2}x10^21 cm-2, errors at 90% c.l.) is much larger
than the column density in this direction of the Galaxy (N_H=8x10^20 cm-2,
Dickey & Lockman 1990, or N_H=5x10^20 cm-2 based on Schlegel et al. 1998 
maps).
Fixing the column density to N_H=8x10^20 cm-2 results in a unacceptable fit
with chi2_red=3.0.
We then include an absorption component at the redshift of the afterglow,
keeping fixed the Galactic column density to N_H=8x10^20 cm-2.
The new fit is good (chi2_red=1.0) providing a heavily absorbed 
afterglow with
N_H=1.3_{-0.3}^{+0.6}x10^22 cm-2. The redshift is relatively well 
constrained to
z=0.9_{-0.2}^{+0.9}. The power law photon index is Gamma=2.3+/-0.1 and
the unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux is 3.4x10^{-13} erg cm-2 s-1.

The 0.2-10 keV pn light curve shows a clear decay in time. We excluded from
this analysis the first 4 ks when the XMM-Newton pointing was not 
definitive.
A power law decay with t^{-1.6+/-0.2} can account for the main decay.""

We observed the localization region of the short GRB200514B (trigger
611140062) detected by the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the Fermi
satellite with the Palomar 48 inch telescope equipped with the 47 square
degree Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera. We obtained a series of g-
and r-band images covering 519.3 square degrees beginning at 10:01 UT on
2020 May 14 (0.9 hours after the burst trigger time). This corresponds to
~49% of the probability enclosed in the GRB localization map (GCN 27736).
Each exposure was 300s, reaching a g-band median depth of 21.8 mag and
r-band median depth of 22.0 mag. The images were processed in real-time
through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC (Masci et
al. 2019).

We queried the ZTF alert stream using Kowalski (Duev et al. 2019) and AMPEL
(Nordin et al. 2019). We required at least 2 detections separated by at
least 15 minutes to select against moving objects. Furthermore, we
cross-matched our candidates with the Minor Planet Center to flag known
asteroids, reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018), and apply
machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019). We require no spatially
coincident ZTF alert to be issued before the detection time of the GBM
trigger. The candidates within the 90% probability contour of the GRB
localization map that passed the automatic selection criteria and human
vetting are presented in the table below.

We examined the latest, enhanced XRT position of the long GRB 200729A detected by Swift (Evans et al., GCN 28165) in PAN-STARRS imaging. We downloaded the Pan-STARRS DR1 images and note the presence of a faint source detected within the XRT error circle (90% confidence Osborne et al., GCN 28168) at:

RA (J2000) = 12:17:30.32
Dec (J2000) = +45:35:41.4

The location of this source is consistent with the pre-burst counterpart detected in Spitzer/IRAC imaging (Laskar et al., GCN 28171).  Using a 1.5 arcsec aperture, we measure that the source has i=21.4+/-0.2 mag, y=21.0+/-0.2 mag, and z=21.0+/-0.1 mag. We note that our z-band photometry is 1 magnitude brighter than the limit reported by NOT (Malesani et al., GCN 28169). The source is not obviously detected in either Pan-STARRS g or r-band imaging. The source may be marginally extended, although it is too faint to definitively determine whether the source is intrinsically extended beyond the PSF of the Pan-STARRS DR1 imaging. 

Based on the column of neutral hydrogen inferred from the Swift/XRT X-ray spectrum (7.1e21 cm-2; https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_unenh_positions/00984929/), the total optical extinction to any counterpart is approximately A_V = 3.7 mag (Guver & Ozel, 2009, MNRAS, 400, 2050).  Assuming the Pan-STARRS source is in NGC 4242 with a TRGB distance of 5.3 Mpc (Sabbi et al. 2018, ApJS, 235, 23), any stellar counterpart would have M_i~-9.3 mag, which is extremely luminous for a star even with initial mass > 25 M_sun.  Thus the lack of an optical or near-infrared counterpart (Hu et al., GCN 28167; Lipunov et al., GCN 28166; Malesani et al., GCN 28169; DAvanzo et al., GCN 28170) and large implied luminosity suggests that a supernova or non-terminal outburst from such a star in NGC 4242 is unlikely.

Alternatively, if the source is a background galaxy, and the i-z color represents a 4000 Angstrom break, this places the redshift of the galaxy at z~1.1, which would provide a natural explanation for the faint XRT flux (GCN 28165), and the lack of detected optical or NIR afterglow.",1.1,GRB 200729A,Swift,Spectroscopic

We report the discovery of the fast optical transient ZTF20acozryr/AT2020yxz
with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al.
2019) at coordinates (J2000, <0.5):

RA = 02:48:44.31 (42.1846d)

Dec = +12:08:14.08 (+12.1372d)

ZTF20acozryr was found by the new ZTF Realtime Search and Triggering
(ZTF-ReST) project, which aims at near real-time identification of
compelling kilonova candidates in ZTF data using the methods described in
Andreoni et al. (2020d), independently of gravitational-wave or gamma-ray
triggers.

ZTF20acozryr was first detected on 2020-11-03 09:44 UT, hereafter labelled
T_det. It faded by ~0.7 mag in g-band in the first 0.9 days since T_det.
The transient was last detected on 2020-11-05 08:13:20 UT at r = 19.9  0.2
mag. Stringent upper limits constrain the transient onset time to be within
~1 day from T_det. The color of the transient appears to be red, with
g-r~0.3 at T_det. The Galactic extinction on the line of sight is low, with
E(B-V)=0.10 mag (Planck Collaboration et al., 2015).

In the table below, we report photometry obtained on images processed in
real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC
(Masci et al. 2019).

----------------------------------

ZTF20acozryr is located off the Galactic plane, with Galactic latitude
b_Gal = -41.5 deg. Deep Legacy Survey and Pan-STARRS1 images of the field
do not reveal any permanent source at the transient location. There are two
nearby sources reported in the Legacy Survey DR8 catalog. The first source
(RA, Dec = 42.1845d, 12.1358d) has a separation of 5.24 arcsec (with a
galaxy classification from DR8) from ZTF20acozryr and has reported
magnitudes of g=24.38 mag, r=23.45 mag, and z=23.04 mag. The second source
(RA, Dec = 42.1861d, 12.1395d) has a separation of 9.60 arcsec from
ZTF20acozryr (with a point source classification from DR8) and has reported
magnitudes of g=24.84 mag, r=24.07 mag, and z=23.49 mag.

There do not appear to be any publicly reported GRBs consistent with the
sky location between the last non-detection and the first detection.

We encourage spectroscopic classification and multi-wavelength follow-up to
discern the nature of ZTF20acozryr, a potential orphan afterglow candidate.

centered at 5.1696 days after the GRB, under good conditions but 
mediocre seeing.

The afterglow (Kann et al., GCNs #29296,29300; Siegel et al., GCN

mag, vs. a several nearby SDSS stars converted to Ic following the 
Lupton transformations, then transformed back to AB mag).

This magnitude lies slightly above the extrapolation of the decay found 
during the first two epochs (Kann et al., GCN #29300) and may indicate 
an underlying host galaxy. Indeed we also see another faint, possibly 
extended source about 2"" to the East, at RA (J2000) = 14:36:01.453, Dec. 
(J2000) = +33:03:13.40, which may be the host galaxy or a system

GRB 210204A was triggered by the Fermi-GBM at 06:29:25 UT on 4 Feb 2021
(GCNs 29390, and 29393) and the prompt emission was also detected by other
space-based facilities like GECAM (29392), AstroSat (GCN 29410), and
Konus-Wind (GCNC 29415) up to MeV energies.  So, we searched for extended
GeV emission for a temporal window of 50 ks since GBM trigger-based on
available LAT data, however,  we do not find detection of any GeV photons
with a probability greater than 50 % to be associated with the source.

The optical counterpart associated with this burst was independently
discovered by Kool et al., 2021 using the ZTF telescope (GCN 29405) and
later follow-up observations were continued by several ground-based
facilities (GCNs 29411, 29414, 29417, 29432, 29433, and 29438). Xu et al.
2021 report a redshift value of 0.876 for this burst using
VLT/X-shooter observations
(GCN 29411).

We performed late time follow-up observations of the optical counterpart
using the 4Kx4K CCD Imager (Pandey et al. 2017, arXiv:1711.05422v1) mounted
at the axial port of the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope of ARIES Nainital
starting ~ 58 hours after the burst. Multiple frames were taken in various
broad-band filters including B, V, R, and I bands. A fading afterglow
candidate was clearly seen in individual frames decayed around ~ 0.6 mags
in R Band during our observing run. We report the preliminary brightness of
the afterglow to be R= 20.19 +/- 0.03 mag ~ 58 hours after the GBM trigger.
The magnitude value reported is calibrated against UNSO B1 nearby stars.
Our R-band light curve along with early data published by Kool et al., 2021
(GCN 29405) is well-described with a broken power-law model. We found that
the temporal decay index before break time (~ 36 hours post burst) is 0.55
+/- 0.03 steepen to 1.43 +/- 0.09 at later epochs. Considering this break
as a jet break (as reported in GCN 29433), we calculated the optical
spectral index (using BVRI data at ~ 58 hours) \beta_O to be 1.08 +/- 0.10.
Considering the closure relations after the jet break (both for ISM and
WIND like a medium, without energy injection), the optical emission could
be better described with spectral regime \nu > \nu_c for WIND medium
demanding electron energy index value $p$ equal to 2.16 +/- 0.20 for the
available data-set so far.

et al., GCN #29699, Fermi GBM detection: Hamburg & Meegan, GCN #29709; 
Konus-Wind detection: Frederiks et al., GCN #29713) with OSIRIS at the 
10.4m GTC telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, in La Palma 
(Spain). The observation started at 05:31 UT (0.3118 days after the 
burst), and consisted of 3 x 600s with grism R1000B, covering the 
spectral range from 3700 to 7800 AA. Observations were taken at high 
airmass, near dawn.

The 60 s acquisition image, with a seeing of 1"".3, shows the afterglow 
at a magnitude of r' = 23.03 +/- 0.15 mag, using a nearby Pan-STARRS 
field star as photometric reference. This is in agreement with the NOT 
measurement.

Spectral continuum is faintly detected above 5000 AA, and shows no clear 
evidence for any absorption or emission lines. We therefore place a weak 
upper limit of z < 3.1 on the redshift of GRB 210323A. There may be 
evidence for a low-significance emission line at 5110 AA, which is 
slightly offset from the continuum trace in the 2D spectrum. It is found 
using multiple reductions and analyses. Interpreting this line as [OII], 
the corresponding redshift would be z = 0.37. However, we do not find 
any evidence for other emission lines, such as Hbeta and [OIII], at the 
corresponding redshift, placing its reality in doubt.

Further observations will be required to verify the reality of this 
feature and to attempt a redshift determination through host galaxy 
spectroscopy.",z < 3.1,GRB 210323A,GTC (10.4m),Spectroscopic

We have analysed 5.8 ks of XRT data for GRB 210610B (Page et al. GCN
Circ. 30170), from 87 s to 81.7 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 1.3 ks in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 30189).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=1.13 (+0.23, -0.34). At T+133 s  the decay
steepens to an alpha of 1.86 (+0.06, -0.05). The light curve breaks
again at T+397 s to a decay with alpha=0.77 (+0.06, -0.05),  before a
final break at T+1153 s s after which the decay index is 1.105 (+0.023,
-0.022).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.847 (+/-0.022). The
best-fitting absorption column is  4.4 (+/-2.5) x 10^20 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 1.13, in addition to the Galactic value of 3.9 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index
of 1.92 (+/-0.12) and a best-fitting absorption column of 1.1 (+1.4,
-1.1) x 10^21 cm^-2. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV
flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.4 x 10^-11 (3.9

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:

We observed the optical counterpart to GRB 210619B (D'Avanzo et al.,

the 60 inch telescope at Palomar Observatory. The SEDM is a low
resolution (R ~ 100) integral field unit spectrometer with a multi-band
(ugri) rainbow camera imager (see Blagorodnova et al. 2018, PASP,
130, 035003, and Rigault et al. 2019, A&A, 627, A115). The SEDM
began observing the optical counterpart at 06:37:52 UTC (6.5 hours
after the burst trigger time). We performed a 2880 s exposure over the
wavelength range 3800-9200 A.

The continuum emission is well-fit by a power law spectrum with index
alpha = 2.8 (f_nu ~ nu^-alpha). The noise level of the spectrum,
especially at wavelengths bluer than 5000 A, make it difficult to confirm
the redshift reported by OSIRIS/GTC (GCN 30272).

We observed the location of GRB 211227A (Beardmore et al., GCN 31316) 
using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter 
spectrograph. Short images were secured with the acquisition camera in 
the g, r, and z filters. No new object is detected inside the revised 
XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN 31322) down to an AB magnitude r > 
24.7 (mean time Dec 28.191 UT).

The galaxy mentioned by Fu et al. (GCN 31320) is well detected in our 
image. Its core lies 3.66"" away of the center of the XRT circle (2.4"" 
90% error radius), though its wings extend towards it.

A spectrum of this object was secured, covering the wavelength range 
3000-21000 AA, and consisting of 4 exposures of 600 s each. The 
observation mid time was 2021 Dec 28.21 UT (5.60 hr after the GRB). We 
detect several emission lines, which we interpret as due to [O II], 
Hbeta, [O III] 5007, Halpha, [N II], [S II] all at a common redshift z = 
0.228. Absorption features due to Ca II 3933/3968 and the Na I D doublet 
5890/5896 are also visible at the same redshift. This value is 
consistent with the SDSS photometric redshift. The galaxy is fairly 
bright, with an absolute magnitude M_r ~ -21.3 (AB) using i = 18.84 (AB) 
from SDSS.

We point out the similarity of the gamma-ray light curve of GRB 211227A 
(e.g. https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1091101/BA/) with that of GRB 
060614 (e.g. Gehrels et al. 2006, Nature, 444, 1044), suggested by some 
authors to be a merger event (e.g. Yang et al. 2015, Nat. Comm., 6, 
7323). The location of the GRB, slightly offset from a bright, nearby 
galaxy, would also be consistent with this interpretation. We raise the 
possibility that GRB 211227A is a short GRB with extended emission. 
However, a long GRB, either hosted by the z = 0.228 galaxy, or in the 
background, remains a viable possibility.

We encourage further observations of this potentially interesting event 
at all wavelengths.

possible high luminosity, we triggered follow-up photometry with the
Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) on the 60-inch telescope at
Palomar Observatory (P60). SEDM photometry obtained the night after
discovery established a rapid fade rate of 2.25 magnitudes in 0.88 days as
well as red colors (g-r=0.41  0.08, corrected for Galactic extinction).
The transient was also detected as part of the ZTF public survey that
night, and the rapid fade triggered the ZTFReST pipeline (Andreoni &
Coughlin et al. 2021).

Konus-Wind detected a long-duration GRB at UT 2022-02-19 09:27:25.350 that
is consistent with the position of AT2022cva. The GRB burst time is 2.5
hours before the first ZTF detection. The GRB was also weakly detected by
BAT. The ZTF optical position was outside the coded BAT FoV at the time of
the burst, and the observed counts are consistent with a relatively soft
burst coming from outside the BAT field of view. The Konus-BAT IPN annulus
is consistent with the position of the ZTF transient, and the association
is highly likely.

We conclude that AT2022cva is the likely afterglow to the Konus-Wind GRB.
Given the possible low redshift (z~0.3) continued photometric and
spectroscopic observations are encouraged.

On May 22.16 UT (T0+4.5 hr after the GRB) we observed the afterglow, of GRB 220521A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 32075; Dichiara et al., GCN 32076; Poolakkil & Meegan, GCN 32089; Strausbaugh et al., GCN 32091) with the Gemini-South telescope and the GMOS camera.

We performed a series of spectroscopic observations with the R400 grating centered at 7500 AA (2x600 s) and 8100 AA (2x600 s). Observations were obtained at an average airmass of 2.34.  In our 300 s, z-band acquisition image we detected the GRB counterpart at the NOT optical afterglow location (Malesani et al., GCN 32078).

In our preliminary analysis we measured z (AB)=20.9 +/- 0.3, calibrated against 10 PS1 stars. No extinction correction has been applied.

Our visual inspection of the spectroscopic data confirms the redshift reported by Fynbo et al. (GCN 32079) as z=5.57 based on the detection of Lyman alpha, SiIV and Ni lines.

Combined with the results from MMT (Rastinejad et al., GCN 32097)we derive a decay index in z-band of alpha=1.57, consistent with the current X-ray behavior  (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 32086). Further analysis is in progress.

SPI-ACS/INTEGRAL. Using GBM/Fermi data we estimated the duration of T_90 
= 12.0 +/- 0.5 s in 7 - 100 keV energy band and performed spectral 
analysis in the time interval of (-1, 12) s. The best fit is obtained 
for CPL model with following parameters: E_p = 62 (-15, +68) keV, alpha 
= -1.5 +/- 0.4. The fluence of F = (9.8 +/- 1.2)E-7 erg/cm**2 is 
obtained in 10 - 1000 keV energy band. The parameters are close to those 
reported in (Poolakkil and Meegan, GCN 32089).
Using redshift of z = 5.6 (Fynbo et al., GCN 32079; Cucchiara et al., 
GCN 32099) we obtain E_iso = (6.2  0.8)E52 erg in 1-10000 keV energy 
range. Using T_90,i - EH diagram [1,2] we classify the burst as type II 
(long burst) for any possible redshift greater than z = 0.07. T_90,i -

Comparing fluences of long-duration GRBs registered by both SPI-ACS and

We report on initial NICER observations of the exceptionally bright GRB
221009A, at a redshift of 0.1505 (GCN #32648, #32686) and observed from
radio to TeV energies (GCNs #32632, #32635, #32636, #32641, #32658, #32661,
#32668, #32677, and ATels #15653, #15655, #15656, #15660, #15661). NICER
observed GRB 221009A intermittently from 2022 Oct 9 17:11 to Oct 11 00:12
UT, or 14.7 ksec to 126 ksec after the Fermi/GBM trigger time (GCN #32636).
During this period, NICER made 12 observations with exposure times ranging
from 40 to 400 sec each. The initial count rate registered with NICER is
1400 counts/s which declined to about 38 counts/s at the time of the last
observation reported here. From a preliminary analysis, we find that the
decline follows a power law with an index of -1.6. The 1-10 keV spectrum of
each observation is well reproduced by an absorbed power-law model with a
spectral index of about 2.0. We used the tbabs model with wilms abundance
in XSPEC (Wilms, Allen & McCray 2000) for an assumed Galactic absorption of
5.4 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013; GCN #32651). The average column
density of these observations with the ztbabs model is 1.1 x 10^22 cm^-2 at
a redshift of 0.151 (GCN #32648). The absorbed (unabsorbed) flux in the 0.3
- 10 keV band declined from 6.1 x 10^-9 (1.3 x 10^-8) to 1.8 x 10^-10 (3.3
x 10^-10) erg/sec/cm^2.

NICER initially received notification of the GRB through OHMAN (On-orbit
Hookup of MAXI and NICER) at 14:10:57 UT on Oct 9, but poor visibility
delayed a prompt follow-up.  OHMAN is software on an International Space
Station laptop computer that provides a new automated triggering
capability, monitoring live MAXI data and communicating new transient
alerts to NICER for follow-up within minutes, visibility permitting. NICER
is continuing to monitor GRB 221009A.  Detailed temporal and spectral
analysis is ongoing.

The pointed observation was conducted from 2022-10-12T05:31:48

to 2022-10-12T05:51:39 with a net exposure of 1012 s. The X-ray

a Galactic absorption of 5.4 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013;

Melandri (INAF-OAB) and M.A. Williams report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 6.4 ks of XRT data for GRB 221110A (Williams et al.
GCN Circ. 32925), from 64 s to 40.0 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 55 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 9 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Evans et
al. (GCN Circ. 32929).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.971 (+0.028, -0.027).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.88 (+/-0.15). The
best-fitting absorption column is  8 (+14, -8) x 10^21 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 4.06, in addition to the Galactic value of 1.5 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed)
0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.4 x
10^-11 (3.6 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Galactic foreground: 1.5 x 10^20 cm^-2
Intrinsic column:    8 (+14, -8) x 10^21 cm^-2 at z=4.06
Photon index:	     1.88 (+/-0.15)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.971, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 9.2 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 3.1 x
10^-13 (3.3 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

We obtained a second epoch of JWST observations of the exceptionally bright GRB 230307A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 33405; Xiong et al., GCN 33406; Xiao & Krucker, GCN 33410; Cosentini et al., GCN 33412; Navaneeth et al., GCN 33415) on 8 May 2023 (about 62 days post-burst). Imaging was obtained with NIRCam in the F115W, F150W, F277W and F444W filters and spectroscopy with the NIRSpec prism.

The source at the location of the optical/IR afterglow (Levan et al., GCNs 33439, 33569) is still detected but has faded significantly, particularly in the redder bands. In the F444W filter, it faded by 2.7 mag. 

This result confirms that the very red continuum noted in the first epoch by Levan et al. (GCN 33569) is due to a variable source and does not contain a significant contribution from any underlying host. However, we do note the presence of a faint galaxy, approximately 0.3” from the burst position, which is plausibly the source of the emission lines seen in previous NIRSpec spectroscopy (Levan et al., GCN 33580). Although further analysis is required, the rapid IR fading is consistent with the expectations of kilonova emission. If that interpretation is correct, the higher redshift source has to be an unrelated background galaxy, aligned by chance with the GRB. Alternatively, if associated with the galaxy at z = 3.87, the counterpart would have exhibited unprecedented temporal and chromatic behaviour. ",3.87,GRB 230307A,Hubble Space Telescope,Spectroscopic

We obtained 10x360s exposures in the V-band with a mid-epoch of 2023-08-13 22:00 UT (~1 day after trigger), 2x300s exposures in the R-band with a mid-epoch of 2023-08-14 00:00 UT, and 10x360s exposures in the I band with a mid-epoch of 2023-08-13 20:40 UT.
We derive the following photometry, calibrated against the Pan-STARRS catalog and not corrected for Galactic dust reddening:

V = 20.87 +/- 0.08 mag
R = 20.64 +/- 0.09 mag
I = 19.77 +/- 0.04 mag

We also observed the field of GRB 230812B using the T193cm equipped with the MISTRAL spectro-imager. We obtained 4x300s + 1x60s exposures in the r’ band at a mid-epoch of 2023-08-13 20:15 UT, leading to the following preliminary photometry estimate:

r’ = 20.32 +/- 0.06 mag

We finally obtained 1h of exposure (2x15min + 1x30min) in spectroscopic mode, using the blue setting of MISTRAL. We clearly detect the continuum associated with the transient emission, leading to a redshift upper limit (z<2.5) consistent with the redshift determination obtained by the GTC and the NOT (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 24409, 34410). The signal to noise in the final combined spectrum is however not sufficient to securely identify any absorption line.

We observed the field of GRB 230816A detected by SWIFT (Siegel  et al., GCN 34450) with 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). We started observations at 16:40:00 UT, i.e., 31.2 mins after the Swift/BAT trigger. We obtained 5 frames in the r' band of 300 sec each. After image subtraction, we detected a source in our stacked image at RA 21:53:46.96, Dec: +37:51:16.08 with an uncertainty of 0.67 arcsec - coincident with the reported afterglow (Jiang et al., GCN 34453), and 3.75 arsec away from center of the XRT error circle (Siegel et al., GCN 34450). 

We note that there is a faint source (m_r ~ 23.0) nearly coincident with the counterpart in the Pan-STARRS1 images, which could be a host of this GRB. Our image subtraction ensures that this source flux does not affect out photometric measurements. There is no minor planet present at this position. The photometric results are as follows:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the

ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+231.3 ks and T0+249.7
ks. 

An uncatalogued X-ray source is detected consistent with being within
9.9 arcsec of the position of ZTF23abaanxz/AT2023qxj (GCN Circ. 34574)
and is believed to be the afterglow. Using 3821 s of PC mode data and 4
UVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec = 299.63944, +54.46318 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 19h 58m 33.47s
Dec(J2000): +54d 27' 47.5""

with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 0.8 arcsec from the ZTF position.  The light curve is
consistent with a constant source of mean count rate 7.0e-02 ct/sec. A
power-law fit gives an index of 2.490 (+0.015, -2.990).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.59 (+0.33, -0.30). The
best-fitting absorption column is  4.0 (+2.1, -1.0) x 10^21 cm^-2,
consistent with the Galactic value of 3.0 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et
al. 2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux
conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 5.0 x 10^-11 (6.4 x
10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 231215A detected by Swift/BAT (D’Avanzo et al., GCN 35343, Evans et al., GCN 35345, Pankov et al., GCN 35349), using the 2.56-m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC camera. Observations started at 20:23:33 UT on 2023-12-15, i.e., 10.6 hr after the BAT trigger. We obtained 2x120 s in the Sloan r-band and then 2x1800 s spectroscopy.

The previously reported optical counterpart (e.g., Lipunov et al., GCN 35347, Pankov et al., GCN 35349, Sasada et al., GCN 35351, An et al., GCN 35353, Wagh et al., GCN 35354, Hu et al., GCN 35363, Turpin et al., GCN 35367) was clearly detected in our stacked image with m(r) = 21.21 +/- 0.03 at 10.64 hr post-burst, calibrated with nearby Pan-STARRS stars.

However, the S/N of the spectrum is quite low. The spectrum shows a rather flat and featureless continuum. No unambiguous absorption feature can be identified at the reported GTC redshift (Thoene et al., GCN 35373).

We observed the optical afterglow candidate of GRB 240209A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 35343) reported by the GOTO team (Belkin et al. GCN 35715) and also followed-up by the NOT and Wendelstein telescopes (de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN 35716, Busmann et al. GCN 25724) using the T193cm telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France) equipped with the MISTRAL instrument. We took two series of r-band and g-band images (3x10min for each band) starting at 2024-02-14 04:00:34 UT. In both single and combined frames we detect the optical source at a high S/N. We performed forced photometry at the position of the source both on the science and difference image (we used PanSTARRS template images to make the subtraction) as the close HyperLEDA 2722973 galaxy might affect our measure. We derived the following magnitudes :
----------------------------------------------------------
T-T0 (in days, midtime) | mag | filter | subtracted
----------------------------------------------------------
4.893 | 20.06 ± 0.03 mag (AB) | r' | y
4.893 | 19.41 ± 0.02 mag (AB) | r' | n
4.919 | 20.02 ± 0.01 mag (AB) | g' | y
4.919 | 19.78 ± 0.01 mag (AB) | g' | n
-----------------------------------------------
The photometric calibration was performed using nearby stars from the PanSTARRS catalog and magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction and the uncertainties are statistical only.
We note that our residual image magnitudes suggest a fading behavior of the source with respect to the NOT and the Wendelstein r-band epochs while the forced photometry on science images is in very good agreement with them. Further investigations about the potential flux contamination due to the presence of the HyperLEDA 2722973 galaxy will be done.

In addition to our photometric observations, we also performed spectroscopic observations of the source and the HyperLEDA 2722973 galaxy with the blue mode of MISTRAL. A total exposure of 20 minutes was obtained.
The preliminary analysis of the spectrum of the source suggests a rather blue transient (in agreement with the g-r ~ -0.04 we measured  from difference image analysis) but at odds with typical GRB afterglow red colors. Due to the low S/N of the spectrum, we did not identify clear spectral features to estimate a redshift.
The MISTRAL spectrum of the HyperLEDA 2722973 galaxy shows a clear absorption complex that could be identified with the 5175A/5269A lines. This would suggest a redshift of z~0.207, close to the photometric value of z=0.1629+/-0.0150.

Further observation will be taken on Saturday night at OHP (weather permitting) to better characterize the color evolution of this transient.

We acknowledge the excellent support from Observatoire de Haute-Provence, in particular Stéphane Favard for the MISTRAL observations and the SOPHIE observer Magali Deleuil.

3695,2005-07-28 19:27:12.000,"GRB050713: analysis of the XMM-Newton observationAndrea De Luca (IASF Mi) on behalf of a larger collaboraton 
report:

We have analyzed the data from the XMM-Newton observation 
of GRB050713A, discovered by Swift on 2005, July 13 at 
04:29:02.39 UT (Falcone et al., GCN3581).

The XMM-Newton observation started on 2005, July 13 at 
10:18 UT and lasted for 30.7 ks. We report here on the 
analysis of data collected with the EPIC/pn detector, 
which started observing the field at 10:54 UT (~6h 20min 
after the GRB).

As reported by Loiseau et al. (GCN3594), the afterglow of 
GRB050713A is clearly detected in the pn image, at a 
position fully consistent with the refined Swift/XRT one 
(Morris et al., GCN3606). 
Extracting source events from a circle of 25 arcsec radius 
(containing ~80% of the total counts), the time-averaged, 
background-subtracted count rate in the 0.2-8 keV range 
is 0.547+/-0.005 cts/s.

The afterglow is clearly seen to fade along the XMM-Newton 
observation, spanning the time range 23.5-51.5 ks after 
the GRB. The background-subtracted light curve (0.5-5 keV) 
is well fitted (reduced chi2=0.9, 26 d.o.f.) by a power law 
decay with index delta=1.45+/-0.07 (90% c.l.). 
The afterglow decay has significantly steepened with 
respect to the epoch of the earlier Swift observation: 
Morris et al. (GCN 3606) observed an index delta=0.82+/-0.11
in the time range 5-10 ks after the burst using Swift/XRT data. 
This implies the presence of a break in the afterglow X-ray
light curve between 10 ks and 23.5 ks from the GRB.

We extracted the time-averaged spectrum and generated ad-hoc 
response and effective area files. We quote here errors at 
90% level for a single interesting parameter, unless otherwise 
specified.

A fit in the energy range 0.2-8 keV with an absorbed power 
law model yields a reduced chi2 of 1.25 for 172 d.o.f. 
The resulting NH=(3.25+/-0.15)x10^21 cm^-2 is higher than 
the expected Galactic value in the burst direction (NH=1.1x10^21 
cm^-2, Dickey & Lockman, 1990); the best fitting power law photon 
index is Gamma=2.16+/-0.05.
Such results are consistent with the XRT ones (Morris et al., 
GCN 3606), which implies no significant spectral evolution with
respect to the earlier phase of the afterglow.

A better fit to the pn spectrum (reduced chi2=0.97, 171 dof) 
may be obtained fixing the NH to the expected Galactic value 
(NH=1.1x10^21 cm^-2) and adding a neutral, redshifted absorber 
component to the spectral model. With a simple F-test we evaluate 
the chance occurrence probability of the improvement to be 
of 5x10^-11. The best fit value for the intrinsic NH is 4.0x10^21 
cm^-2, while the best fit value for the redshift z is 0.55.
At 90% c.l. for 2 parameters, we obtain the following ranges:
intrinsic NH=(0.4-3.2)x10^22 cm^-2; redshift z=(0.4-2.6).
Using such model, the resulting power law photon index is 
Gamma=2.04+/-0.05.
The observed flux is of 2.2x10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in 0.2-10 keV;
the corresponding unabsorbed flux is of 3.8x10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

As a last step, we divided the pn dataset into two time intervals 
of ~9500 s and ~14600 s (each containing about half of the counts 
from the afterglow) and we repeated the spectral analysis. 
We found no significant spectral changes in the two considered 
intervals.",0.55,GRB050713A,XMM-Newton,Spectroscopic

(PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU) and P.A. Evans report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 8.6 ks of XRT data for GRB 240825A, from 71 s to 56.6
ks after the  BAT trigger. The data comprise 1.2 ks in Windowed Timing
(WT) mode (the first 10 s were taken while Swift was slewing) with the
remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=3.13 (+0.24, -0.21). At T+119 s  the decay
flattens to an alpha of 0.83 (+/-0.06). The light curve breaks again at
T+406 s to a decay with alpha=1.121 (+0.019, -0.028),  and  again at
T+1288 s s to alpha=1.52 (+6.48, -0.05),  before a final break at
T+6251 s s after which the decay index is 1.25 (+0.06, -0.08).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.661 (+/-0.017). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.09 (+/-0.04) x 10^22 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 0.659, in addition to the Galactic value of 5.3 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index
of 1.76 (+/-0.09) and a best-fitting absorption column of 9.1 (+1.6,
-1.4) x 10^21 cm^-2. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV
flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 4.4 x 10^-11 (5.9
x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Galactic foreground: 5.3 x 10^20 cm^-2
Intrinsic column:    9.1 (+1.6, -1.4) x 10^21 cm^-2 at z=0.659
Photon index:	     1.76 (+/-0.09)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.25, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.093 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 4.1 x
10^-12 (5.5 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

Report on behalf of the SVOM team:

During the commissioning phase, the SVOM/GRM was triggered in-flight by GRB 241105A (SVOM trigger reference: sb24110502) at 2024-11-05T16:06:05.00 UT (T0), which was also observed by Fermi/GBM (Fermi GBM Team, GCN 38085), Konus-Wind (D. Frederiks et al., GCN 38103), and Swift/BAT (J. DeLaunay et al., GCN 38108).

The real-time alert data and light curves of SVOM/GRM were downlinked to the ground through the VHF system with low latency. With the event-by-event data downloaded through the X-band ground station, the GRM light curve shows that this burst consists of a short single pulse with a duration of about 2 s and a weaker extended emission with a duration of about 40 s. The significance of extended emission observed by GRD03 is about 3.6 sigma from T0+2 to T0+42 s.

The initial pulse spectrum from T0-0.5 to T0+1.7 s is best fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.93 +/- 0.54 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 214 +/- 59 keV. The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (1.05 +/- 0.19)E-06 erg/cm^2.

The extended emission spectrum from T0+1.7 to T0+42 s is best fit by a power law function. The power law index is -1.63 +/- 0.18. The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (1.76 +/- 0.31)E-07 erg/cm^2.

The time-integrate spectrum from T0-0.5 to T0+42 s is best fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.23 +/- 0.52 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 455 +/- 335 keV. The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (2.13 +/- 0.48)E-07 erg/cm^2. According to the redshift z=2.702 (Izzo et al., GCN 38097), we estimate the burst isotropic equivalent radiated energy, parameterized as Eiso, is (1.76 +/- 0.76)E+53 erg (1-10000 keV).

The burst position (from Swift/BAT) was outside the SVOM/ECLAIRs field of view at trigger time.

The Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is a China-France joint mission led by the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA, China), National Center for Space Studies (CNES, France) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS, China), which is dedicated to observing gamma-ray bursts and other transient phenomena in the energetic universe.

The observation, a single 600-sec exposure in the SDSS r' filter, started on 2025-01-01 19:56:30 UT, i.e. ~ 6.56 hr after the Swift BAT trigger. We detect the optical afterglow at a position consistent with the Swift UVOT position reported by Page et al. (GCN #38752). We measure a magnitude of r' = 19.96 +/- 0.16 calibrated against PanSTARRS DR1 stars and not corrected for Galactic extinction.

This result is consistent with other reports: Li et al., GCN 38753; Mohan et al., GCN 38754; Zhu et al., GCN 38755; Budnev et al., GCN 38756; Wu et al., GCN 38758; Moskvitin and Spiridonova, GCN 38762;

The spectroscopic redshift of z = 2.49 has been obtained by Zhu et al. (GCN 38759).

on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.8 ks of XRT data for GRB 250101A, from 110 s to 39.2
ks after the  BAT trigger. The data comprise 10 s in Windowed Timing
(WT) mode (taken while Swift was slewing), with the remainder in Photon
Counting (PC) mode. 

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=2.8 (+/-0.7). At T+249 s  the decay
flattens to an alpha of 0.06 (+0.29, -0.74) before breaking again at
T+909 s to a final decay with index alpha=0.79 (+0.13, -0.09).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.02 (+0.18, -0.17). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.7 (+1.3, -1.1) x 10^22 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 2.49, in addition to the Galactic value of 1.4 x 10^21
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed)
0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.6 x
10^-11 (5.1 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Galactic foreground: 1.4 x 10^21 cm^-2
Intrinsic column:    1.7 (+1.3, -1.1) x 10^22 cm^-2 at z=2.49
Photon index:	     2.02 (+0.18, -0.17)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.79, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.018 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 6.4 x
10^-13 (9.1 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

We observed the location of the X-ray afterglow of GRB 250108B (Klinger et al., GCN 38847; Osborne et al., GCN 38848) with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS-N) mounted on Gemini-North under Program GN-2024B-Q-107. We obtained 15x120-s imaging in r-band at a mid-time of 2025-01-08 12:42:45.8 UT (2.33 hours post-burst), at a median airmass of 1.7 and seeing < 1.2''. 

We clearly detect a faint source not present in archival Legacy Survey DR10 r-band imaging but within the XRT localization at a position of

RA (J2000) = 13:25:18.50
Dec (J2000) = 25:36:55.82

with an uncertainty of 0.7''. We suggest that this is the afterglow of GRB 250108B.

We note that the candidate afterglow is 16.8'' offset from a bright galaxy (r = 19.5 AB mag). This galaxy has a Legacy Survey DR9 photometric redshift of z = 0.29 +/- 0.04 (Zhou et al., 2021) and an SDSS photometric redshift of z = 0.22 +/- 0.04 (Alam et al., 2015), corresponding to projected separations of 74 kpc and 60 kpc from the transient, respectively. We determine a probability of chance coincidence between this galaxy and the candidate afterglow of Pcc = 0.13 (Bloom et al., 2002). With present data we cannot rule out the presence of a faint, underlying host at the position of the transient.

Calibrated to SDSS, we measure a preliminary brightness for the optical source of r = 23.4 +/- 0.1 AB mag, not corrected for Galactic extinction. At a redshift of z = 0.29, this corresponds to an optical luminosity of 2.1 x 10^42 erg/s.

ks after the  BAT trigger. The data comprise 317 s in Windowed Timing
(WT) mode (the first 9 s were taken while Swift was slewing) with the
remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

The late-time light curve (from T0+4.6 ks) can be modelled with an
initial rise, with a power-law index of alpha=-0.94 (+1.18, -0.25),
followed by a break at T+8035 s  to an alpha of 1.32 (+0.31, -0.29).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.09 (+/-0.03). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.8 (+/-0.9) x 10^22 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 4.732, in addition to the Galactic value of 5.1 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index
of 1.87 (+0.14, -0.13) and a best-fitting absorption column of 1.0

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of

We have computed preliminary error bars on the temporal and spectral
indexes of Haislip et al. (GCN 3914).  The temporal index is -1.20 +/- 0.17
and the spectral index is -0.35 +/- 0.33.  This disfavors the ISM-RED and
WIND-RED cases at the 2.2 sigma confidence level, the ISM-BLUE case at the
1.3 sigma confidence level, and the WIND-BLUE case only at the 0.3 sigma
confidence level (e.g., Sari, Piran & Narayan 1998; Chevalier & Li 2000).
If the WIND-BLUE case is borne out by further observations, this suggests
an electron-energy distribution index of p = 1.9 +/- 0.2, as well as a
massive-star origin.

If the NIR afterglow is strongly extinguished, and the intrinsic spectrum
is even shallower than -0.35, or even positive, then none of the standard
cases hold.  This also suggests that the afterglow is probably not strongly
extinguished, and supports the conclusion of Haislip et al. (GCN 3914) that
the sharp spectral break between the J and i bands is likely due to
dropout.

Furthermore, given that the K to J spectral index is so shallow, and the J
to i spectral index is so steep, the redshift range is probably narrower
than that implied by the J and i filter centers (5.3 < z < 9.0), and is
probably between 6 and 8.  Careful modeling will better constrain this, but
z, Z and/or Y observations, preferably contemporaneous with addition NIR
observations would be most useful.",6.0,GRB 050904,Swift,Spectroscopic

on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long-duration GRB 250327B
(SVOM-ECLAIRs detection: Bouchet et al., GCN 39888)
was detected by Konus-Wind (KW) in the waiting mode
at T0 = T0(ECLAIRs) = 76287 s UT (21:11:27).

A Bayesian block analysis of the KW  waiting mode data
in the 20-1200 keV band reveals a ~20 sigma count rate
increase in the interval from ~T0-12 s to ~T0+424 s.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB250327B/

The total burst fluence is 2.31(-0.22,+0.26)x10^-5 erg/cm^2,
and the 2.944 s peak energy flux, measured from T0+85 s,
is 2.43(-0.52,+0.55)x10^-7 erg/cm^2.
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst,
measured from T0-12 s to T0+424 s,
can be described by a power law with exponential cutoff (CPL) model
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -1.11(-0.17,+0.21) and Ep = 212(-38,+48) keV.

The spectrum near the peak count rate, measured from T0+76 s to T0+91 s,
can be described by a CPL model with
alpha = -0.82(-0.31,+0.43) and Ep = 203(-49,+64) keV.

Assuming the redshift z=3.035 (Malesani et al., GCN 39893)
and a standard cosmology with H_0 = 67.3 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.315,
and Omega_Lambda = 0.685 (Planck Collaboration, 2014),
we estimate the following rest-frame parameters:
the isotropic energy release E_iso is 4.78(-0.45,+0.54)x10^53 erg,
the peak luminosity L_iso is 2.03(-0.44,+0.46)x10^52 erg/s,
the rest-frame peak energy of the time-averaged spectrum Ep,i,z is 856(-152,+195) keV and 
the spectrum near the maximum count rate Ep,p,z is 818(-198,+257) keV.

With the obtained estimates, GRB 250327B is inside 68% prediction band for the 'Amati' and 
90% prediction band for the 'Yonetoku' relations derived for the sample of >300 long KW GRBs 
with known redshifts (Tsvetkova et al., 2017; Tsvetkova et al., 2021),

We performed follow-up observations of the optical counterpart (Rakotondrainibe et. al, GCN 40315) to GRB 250502A (Wang et al., GCN 40313) using the 1.5-meter AZT-33IK telescope of the Sayan Solar Observatory (Mondy), and the 1-meter Zeiss-1000 telescope of the Tien-Shan Astronomical Observatory (TSHAO). The optical source was observed also by (An et. al, GCN 40319; Li et. al, GCN 40320; Ghosh et. al, GCN 40322; Ugarte Postigo et. al, GCN 40328; Pérez-Fournon et. al, GCN 40330; Odeh et. al, GCN 40331; Bochenek & Perley, GCN 40333; Corcoran et. al, GCN 40334; Leonini et. al, GCN 40337; Zheng et. al, GCN 40338). The redshift z = 2.163 was determined by Ugarte Postigo et. al, GCN 40328. The X-Ray counterpart was detected by XRT (Dichiara et. al, GCN 40336).

report:

We have analyzed the full FREGATE+WXM data for HETE trigger H3934
(GRB051021.56).

The 30-400 keV light curve has two sharp peaks, separated by about 10 s,
superposed on a gentler rise-and-fall. The burst had a T90 duration of 38s
in the 7-40 keV band, and of 27s in the 30-400 keV band.  Emission in the
2-25 keV band appears to continue for at least 90s post-trigger, mostly
below 10 keV.

The integrated spectrum is well-fit by a cutoff power-law function.  The
best-fit parameters are:

alpha = -1.16 --- 90% confidence interval is [-1.25 -1.06]
Epeak = 94.2  --- 90% confidence interval is [76.7 , 111.7]

The 2-30 keV fluence is 3x10^-6 erg/cm2, while the 30-400 keV fluence is 
6 x 10^-6 keV.  Since the ratio S(2-30)/S(30-400) is 0.41, this event is
classified as an X-Ray Rich GRB.

The pseudo-redshift estimated for this burst is pz = 1.4.

We have analysed 4 ks of XRT observations of GRB051111
(Sakamoto et al., GCN 4248). A bright source is well detected.
The refined coordinates for this X-ray afterglow are:

RA(J2000):   23h 12m 33.362s
Dec(J2000):  18d 22' 29.535""

with an estimated uncertainty of 3.5 arcsec (90% containment) and
including the latest XRT boresight correction.
The position is 71 arcsec from the on-board BAT position reported by
Sakamoto et al. and 2.4 arcsec from the optical afterglow first
detected by ROTSE (Rujopakarn  et al., GCN 4247).

The X-ray light-curve is steeply fading with a slope of -1.9+/-0.2.

The spectrum of the PC data can be modelled with an absorbed power-law
with photon index Gamma = 2.2+/-0.3 (90% containment).
There is a slight evidence for an absorbing column higher than the
Galactic value
(5.02e20 cm^-2) at a level of (9+/-5)e21 cm^-2 at the observed redshift
z=1.55 (Hill et al., GCN 4255).

The 0.2-10 keV unabsorbed flux at 5000 s  is 1.8e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1.
At 10000 s the afterglow had faded to flux level of 5.0e-12 erg cm^-2

W. Hogg (NYU), and Michael R. Blanton (NYU) report on behalf of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Collaboration:

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaged the field of burst
GRB051215 prior to the burst.  As these data should be useful
as a pre-burst comparison and for calibrating photometry, we are
supplying the images and photometry measurements for this GRB field
to the community.

Data from the SDSS, including 5 FITS images, 3 JPGS, and
3 files of photometry and astrometry, are being placed at
http://mizar.as.arizona.edu/~grb/public/GRB051215

We supply FITS images in each of the 5 SDSS bands of a 8'x8' region
centered on the GRB position (ra=163.139 (10:52:33.4), dec=38.6260
(38:37:33.6); GCN 4352), as well as 3 gri color-composite JPGs (with
different stretches). The units in the FITS images are nanomaggies
per pixel.  A pixel is 0.396 arcsec on a side. A nanomaggie is
a flux-density unit equal to 10^-9 of a magnitude 0 source or,
to the extent that SDSS is an AB system, 3.631e-6 Jy.  The FITS
images have WCS astrometric information.

In the file GRB051215_sdss.calstar.dat, we report photometry
and astrometry of 179 bright stars (r<20.5) within 15' of the
burst location.  The magnitudes presented in this file are asinh
magnitudes as are standard in the SDSS (Lupton 1999, AJ, 118,
1406). Beware that some of these stars are not well-detected in
the u-band; use the errors and object flags to monitor data quality.

In the files GRB051215_sdss.objects_flux.dat and
GRB051215_sdss.objects_magnitudes.dat, we report photometry
of 1240 objects detected within 6' of the GRB position.
We have removed saturated objects and objects with model
magnitudes fainter than 23.0 in the r-band.  The fluxes listed
in GRB051215_sdss.objects_flux.dat are in nanomaggies while the
magnitudes listed in GRB051215_sdss.objects_magnitudes.dat are
asinh magnitudes.

All quantities reported are standard SDSS photometry, meaning that
they are very close to AB zeropoints and magnitudes are quoted
in asinh magnitudes.  Photometric zeropoints are known to about
2% rms.  None of the photometry is corrected for dust extinction.
The Schlegel, Finkbeiner, and Davis (1998) predictions for this
region are A_U=0.081 mag, A_g=0.059 mag, A_r = 0.043 mag, A_i=0.033
mag, and A_z=0.023 mag.

The file GRB051215_sdss.spectro.dat contains a list of the 8 objects
with SDSS spectroscopy within 6 arcminutes of the GRB position.
In addition to the redshift and 1-sigma error for each object,
this file also lists the object spectroscopic classification.

Among the spectra, there are 4 galaxies at the same redshift z=0.145.
Most likely, this is the redshift of the cluster noted in Ofek and Gal-Yam
(GCN 4351).  This value is somewhat higher than photometric redshift
estimate of z=0.09 in Gal et al. (2003, AJ, 125, 2064), although there
are also 2 galaxies near that redshift.

SDSS astrometry is generally better than 0.1 arcsecond per
coordinate.  Users requiring high precision astrometry should take
note that the SDSS astrometric system can differ from other systems
such as those used in other notices; we have not checked the offsets
in this region.

See the SDSS DR4 documentation for more details:
http://www.sdss.org/dr4

These data have been reduced using a slightly different pipeline
than that used for SDSS public data releases.  We cannot guarantee
that the values here will exactly match those in the data release
in which these data are included.  In particular, we expect the
photometric calibrations to differ by of order 0.01 mag.

collaboration reports:

We have analyzed the data from the XMM-Newton observation
of GRB051016, discovered by Swift on 2005, October 16 at
05:23:31 UT (Boyd et al., GCN4096).

The XMM-Newton observation started on 2005, October 16 at
13:44 UT and lasted for 29.4 ks. 

As reported by Loiseau and Perez-Martinez (GCN4101), the afterglow of
GRB051016 is clearly detected in the EPIC images and
its position is fully consistent with the refined Swift/XRT one
(Morris et al., GCN3606).

Extracting source events from a circle of 25 arcsec radius
(containing ~80% of the total counts), the time-averaged,
background-subtracted count rate in the 0.5-8 keV range
is 0.028+/-0.001 cts/s, 0.0092+/-0.0006 cts/s and 0.0100+/-0.0006
cts/s in the pn, MOS1 and MOS2 cameras, respectively.

The afterglow is seen to fade along the XMM-Newton
observation, spanning the time range 30.0-59.4 ks after
the GRB. The pn background-subtracted light curve (0.5-8 keV)
is well fitted (reduced chi2=1.0, 7 d.o.f.) by a power law 
decay with index delta=0.9+/-0.3 (90% c.l.). 
The observed afterglow decay is consistent with the XRT
results (Beardmore et al., GCN4100).

We extracted the time-averaged spectra and generated ad-hoc
response and effective area files for the pn, MOS1 and MOS2 
cameras. The spectra were fitted simultaneously.
Unless otherwise specified, we quote errors at 90% level for 
a single interesting parameter.

A fit in the energy range 0.5-8 keV with an absorbed power 
law model yields an unacceptable reduced chi2 of 2.5 for 26 d.o.f.,
The resulting NH=(3.0+/-0.2)x10^21 cm^-2 is somewhat higher than 
the expected Galactic value in the burst direction (NH=1.1x10^21
cm^-2, Dickey & Lockman, 1990); the best fitting power law photon 
index is Gamma=2.6+/-0.3.

A better fit may be obtained fixing the NH to the Galactic 
value and adding a redshifted neutral absorber. This yields a
reduced chi2 of 1.74 for 25 d.o.f. The intrinsic gas column 
density and the redshift are not well constrained owing to their
strong correlation. The best fit values are: intrinsic 
NH=6.7x10^22 cm^-2, z=4.1. At 90% confidence level for 2 parameters,
the intrinsic NH is larger than 5x10^21 cm^-2 and the redshift 
is larger than 0.8. The best fit value of the power law photon index 
is Gamma=2.5+/-0.2. The observed flux (0.5-8 keV) is of 7.6x10^-14
erg cm^-2 s^-1, corresponding to an unabsorbed flux of
1.1x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.",4.1,GRB051016,XMM-Newton,Spectroscopic

Following the revised XRT position (Page et al., GCN 4453), we looked 
again at our VLT images (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 4452) of GRB 060108 (Oates 
et al., GCN 4443; Sakamoto et al., GCN 4445). We still do not detect any 
source inside the revised XRT error circle , down to the limit J > 22.3.

Using the flux and the decay law given by Page et al. (GCN 4452), we 
measure an optical-to-X-ray spectral index alpha_OX < 0.4 (computed 
between 1 keV and 1250 nm, at 0.7 d after the burst). Therefore, GRB 
060108 violates the synchrotron limit and can be classified as a truly 
dark GRB, according to the definition proposed by Jakobsson et al. 
(2004, ApJ, 617, L21).

The lack of absorption in the X-ray spectrum may hint at a high-redshift 
event, rather to a very absorbed one.

Further observations in the near infrared are encouraged.

downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060117 (trigger
#177666) (Campana, et al., GCN 4533).  The BAT ground-calculated
position is RA,Dec = 327.917, -59.967 {21h 51m 40s, -59d 58' 1""}
(J2000) +- 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  This
position includes a small correction for small  BAT image distortions.
We note that this error circle formally excludes the position of IRAS
21482-6015 (GCN 4533, GCN4534).  We also note that fading afterglow
discovered by the FRAM telescope group (Jelinek et al, GCN 4536) is
0.8 arc min from the center of the BAT 90% error circle.  The partial
coding was 25%.

The light curve has multiple peaks, with the main peaks spanning the
time range T-1 to T+17.  T90 (15-350 keV) is (16 +- 1) sec (estimated
error including systematics).  There does appear to be weak emission
extending out to T+100 seconds.

The best fit to the spectral data for the time averaged period from
T-1.98 to T+26.99 seconds is a power law with an exponential cutoff.
This fit gives a photon index 1.51 +- 0.13, and Epeak of 71 +- 5 keV
(chi squared 40 for 59 d.o.f).  For this model the total fluence in the
15-150 keV band is (2.04 +- 0.04) x 10^-05 erg/cm2 and the 1-sec peak
flux measured from T+11.12 sec is 48.9 +- 1.6 ph/cm2/sec.   A fit to a
simple power law gives a photon index of 1.93 +- 0.03  (chi square 68
for 59 d.o.f.)  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

Using the lag-luminosity method of Norris et al. (2000),
and a lag measurement of 25 ms +- 5 ms (1 sigma; 100-350 keV
to 25-50 keV bands), yields a pseudo-redshift of z ~ 1.3 +- 0.3
(includes spectral uncertainties).

The remainder of the expected event data for this burst (from T-300 to T-60

We observed the afterglow of GRB 060116 (Campana et al., GCN 4519; 
Barthelmy et al., GCN 4531). Observations were carried out with the ESO 
NTT telescope in the J and Ks filters. Observations were taken almost 
simultaneously to our VLT I-band observations (D'Avanzo, Malesani & 
Antonelli, GCN 4532), that is ~17 h after the GRB.

We detect the afterglow (Kocevski, Bloom & McGrath, GCNs 4528, 4540) in 
the J and Ks filters. Calibration was performed against the 2MASS 
survey. Comparing our measurements to the limit derived by the VLT 
images, we measure the following colors after correcting for the 
Galactic absorption (E(B-V) = 0.263):

  J-K = 2.5 +- 0.3;
  I-J > 2.9.

These colors are very red. If the I-band nondetection is interpreted as 
a dropout, the inferred redshift is z ~ 6. The very red J-K color may in 
this case suggest some rest-frame dust absorption, as also hinted by the 
large column density present in the X-ray spectrum (Campana et al., GCN 
4529). Alternatively, an even larger redshift (z~7-8) may suppress part 
of the J-band emission.

With the present dataset, however, dust emission at lower redshift 
cannot be excluded.

Further observations and analysis are in progress.

report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

""Following the Swift detection of GRB060418 (Falcone et al., GCN
4966), we triggered observations with the Ultraviolet and Visual
Echelle Spectrograph (UVES), mounted at Kueyen (UT2) of ESO's Very
Large Telescope (VLT). The observations were performed using the
Rapid-Response Mode, which allows for robotic VLT observations without
any human intervention, except for the slit alignment. Starting at
3:16 UT (10min after the Swift/BAT trigger), a series of exposures
with increasing integration times (3, 5, 10, 20, and 40min) were
performed with central wavelengths 390nm in the blue arm and 564nm in
the red, covering 330-670nm at a resolving power of ~43000. This was
followed by a 90min exposure with central wavelengths 437nm in the
blue and 860nm in the red, extending the wavelength coverage up to
950nm.

A preliminary analysis of the spectra shows various absorption
features, which can be identified with typical metal lines originating
in at least four intervening absorbers at redshifts: z=0.602, z=0.655,
z=1.106 and the highest at z=1.489. This confirms the GRB060418
host-galaxy redshift determination by Dupree et al. (GCN 4969).

D. Q. Lamb (Chicago), M. Nysewander (UNC), F. Hearty (Colorado), H.-W.
Chen (Chicago), and D. E. Reichart (UNC) report on behalf of the FUN GRB
Collaboration:


We have further analyzed the Ks-band images taken with the ARC 3.5-meter
telescope using NIC-FPS, beginning 1.6 hours after the burst, and the
Ks-band images taken with the SOAR 4.1-meter telescope using OSIRIS,
beginning 24 hours after the burst.

From the ARC image, we measure a limiting magnitude of Ks = 19.5 (3
sigma) and a magnitude of Ks = 17.78  0.13 mag for the source that is
in the XRT error circle and in the DSS (Price et al., GCN 4854), using
six 2MASS objects (five of ""A"" quality and one of ""C"" quality;
Skrutskie et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 1163) in the NIC-FPS image for
calibration and an aperture radius of 1.6 arcsec, as dictated by a
curve of growth analysis of the source.  The magnitude of Ks = 18.3 
0.1 originally reported by Chen et al. (GCN 4861) corresponded to an 
aperture radius of 1.0 arcsec, and is therefore fainter.

From the SOAR image, we measure a limiting magnitude of Ks = 18.4 (3
sigma) and a magnitude of Ks = 17.53  0.20 for the source, using the
four 2MASS objects (one of ""A"" quality and three of ""C"" quality) in 
the OSIRIS image for calibration and an aperture radius of 1.6 arcsec,
as dictated by a curve of growth analysis of the source.  This result
is consistent with that reported by Nysewander et al. (GCN 4857).

The two results are consistent with a constant brightness source, and
PSF-matched image subtraction provides no indication that the source
brightened between the two epochs.

The source appears to be marginally extended in the ARC image, and may
be the host galaxy (Price et al., GCN 4854).  Spectroscopy of the source
is therefore encouraged.  However, even if the source is the host
galaxy, or a chance-coincidence foreground star (~1% probability),
PSF-matched image subtraction of the Ks-band images does not detect the
afterglow at 1.6 hours after the burst to the limiting magnitude [Ks =
18.4 (3 sigma)] of the SOAR image.

If one assumes minimal extinction in the Ks-band and extrapolates the
unabsorbed X-ray flux (Page et al., GCN 4850) to 1.6 hours after the
burst, the resulting Ks-band to X-ray spectral index is shallower than
-0.48 (3 sigma), using the limiting magnitude of the SOAR image (which
is appropriate if the location of the burst is coincident with the
faint source in the XRT error circle), and shallower than -0.36 (3
sigma), using the limiting magnitude of the ARC image (which is
appropriate if the location of the burst is not coincident with the
faint source in the XRT error circle).  This suggests one or more of
the following possibilities:

1. The redshift of the burst is greater than z ~ 17, which is highly
unlikely.

2.  The cooling break is blueward of the Ks-band at 1.6 hours after the
burst.  Given that the X-ray temporal index is ~-0.6 (Page et al., GCN
4850), the Ks-band to X-ray spectral index would be ~-0.7 (e.g., Sari,
Piran, and Narayan 1998, ApJ, 497, L17) if the cooling break were
instead redward of the Ks band.

3. The afterglow is highly extinguished.  Given that the source-frame
N_H ~ 4 x 1021 cm^-2 (1+z)2.6 (Page et al., GCN 4850; Morrison and
McCammon 1983, ApJ, 270, 119), a redshift of only z ~ 1 is needed in
order to produce 3 - 4 mag of extinction in the observer-frame Ks-band,
provided that dust destruction by the burst and/or its afterglow is
minimal.  Furthermore, a redshift of z ~ 1 yields source-frame values of
N_H that are consistent with giant molecular cloud environments.

Finally, we point out that the properties of the afterglow of this
burst are reminiscent of those of GRB 051022 (Doty et al., GCN 4145;
Butler et al., GCNs 4165 and 4170).",z ~ 1,GRB 060306,SOAR,Photometric

(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 96%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a very long period of emission extending
from T+ ~25 sec to T+ ~330 sec.  There are numerous (6-10) overlapping peaks
in the light curve, with the two brightest peaks at T+ ~140 sec
and T+ ~290 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 276 +- 10 sec (estimated error
including systematics). This stretched-out emission is consistent
with this burst being at high redshift (z=4.9, Price, GCN 5104).
We  have only fragmentary event data after T+423 sec, but the onboard
mask-tagged light curves show no significant emission after this time.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-16.3 sec to T+326.1 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.   The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.76 +- 0.08. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
4.2 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+136.24 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

Given a redshift of z=4.9, we compute Eiso to be 2.04 X 10^53 ergs

Prochaska (UCO/Lick), and H.-W. Chen report:

On 31 May 2006 UT, using Keck I (+LRIS), we obtained spectra of a  
bright red extended source (""G*""; RA, DEC J2000 = 18:35:45.7,  
+52:37:37) that is 11.2 arcsec South of the southern edge of the  
revised XRT error circle (Troja et al. GCN 5093). Strong absorption  
features, which we identify as Ca II H+K, indicate a redshift for  
this early type galaxy of z=0.287. Weak [OII] emission can be seen  
indicating some low level of active star formation.

We advance the hypothesis that this galaxy is the host of short burst  
GRB 060502B (Troja et al. GCN 5055) based on several points:

      1. The galaxy is a massive early-type similar to the putative  
hosts of 050509B [1] and 050724 [2].

      2. The redshift inferred of the hosts of 050509b (z=0.225) and  
050724 (z=0.258) are remarkably similar to that of G* indicating  
comparable energetics of the respective bursts.

      3. At the redshift of z=0.287, the burst location would be  
between 47 - 67 kpc in projection from the center of the putative  
host, similar to the offset (39 +/- 13 kpc) inferred for 050509b.  
There are viable progenitors scenarios (e.g. degenerate binary  
mergers) where bursts occur at such distances from their birthsite.

      4. Weak X-ray afterglow and no detected optical afterglow would  
seem to indicate a low density circumburst environment, as would be  
expected if the GRB originated far from the progenitor birthsite.

We recognize the difficulty of now confirming this hypothesis but  
note that in the striking similarity of the host, redshift,  
afterglow, and offset configuration to GRB 050509b, these  
observations and inferences have a priori precedent.""

We have analyzed the XRT PC mode data for GRB060807 (De Pasquale et al. 2006;
GCN5409), also analyzed carefully by Page et al. (2006; GCN5423).  We find 
identical spectral parameters (within errors) for the absorbed powerlaw model.
However, we note that the fit goodness for the data in the 0.3-10 keV band from 
0.1-250 ksec after the BAT trigger is marginal (chi^2/nu=138.8/103), rejectable 
at 99% confidence.

The spectrum exhibits rare (see, e.g., Butler 2006, astro-ph/0604083, for a 
few additional possible cases) and narrow modulations about the best fit 
model.  We can fit these modulations with 3 unresolved emission lines (giving 
a delta_chi^2 fit improvement of 39.0, for 6 additional degrees of freedom).  
We estimate a significance for the 3 line set of 5.0 sigma, including a 
decrease in the estimated significance due to the search for lines at many 
possible centroid energies in the 0.3-5.0 keV band.  Plots of the spectrum 
with and without the 3 most significant lines can be found at:

http://astro.berkeley.edu/~nat/GRB060807/xrt_060807_nolines.jpg , and
http://astro.berkeley.edu/~nat/GRB060807/xrt_060807_lines.jpg .

The centroid energies of the lines are 0.73, 0.90, and 1.24 keV, 
with uncertainties ~0.05 keV.  The brightest line at 0.73 keV has a flux 
~5 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for the time period 0.1-250 ksec after the
BAT trigger, or 3% of the 0.3-10 keV afterglow flux.

Allowing associations for the lines with K-alpha transitions in H- or He-like 
species of common light metals or any ionization state in the Fe group 
elements, the 3-line set allows several redshift solutions.  The highest 
probability peaks have dz/z~0.2 and occur at z=0.4, 1.0, 1.6, and 4.5.  
The large X-ray absorbing column (e.g., GCN5423) suggests that the source is 
not at high-z.  An optical spectrum of the host galaxy or optical transient
could resolve the redshift degeneracy and would provide important insight 
into the nature of the X-ray emission.","0.4, 1.0, 1.6, and 4.5",GRB060807,NASA,Spectroscopic

We have analyzed the data from the XMM-Newton observation of
GRB060729, discovered by Swift on 2006, Jul 29, 19:12:29 UT
(Grupe et al., GCN5365).

The XMM-Newton observation started on 2006, July 30 07:59 UT
and lasted for ~61 ks. A high particle background level affects
only mildly the whole observation and only the highest flares
have been cut out, in consideration also of the source strength.

The background subtracted pn light curve (0.3-10 keV) shows a
clear decay from about 5 c/s at the beginning of the observation
down to 2 c/s. The light curve can be fit with a power law decay
with index delta=1.04+/-0.02 but with a large chi2=1.8 (58 dof).
This is due to a large bump in the middle of the exposure. Adding
a Gaussian we obtain a better chi2=0.7 (55 dof). The central time
is 69+/-1 ks (90% confidence) from the burst start and the
(Gaussian) width over the time is about 7+/-2%. We note also that
the time of the XMM-Newton observation is close to the break time
observed by Swift XRT in the GRB060729 light curve (Grupe, GCN5432).
Fitting a broken power law to we obtain a first decay index
delta1=0.85+/-0.05, which is inconsistent with the early slope of
0.34 reported by Grupe.

We extracted time-averaged spectra from the EPIC pn camera (since
in the initial part of the MOS observation the GRB spectrum should
be mildly piled-up) and the two RGS spectrometers (first and second
order) and we generated ad-hoc response files.
A simultaneous fit with an absorbed power law model with Galactic
and intrinsic (at a redshift of z=0.54, Thoene et al. GCN5373)
yields a reduced chi2 of 1.05 (1824 dof, without any systematic
error). The resulting NH=(3.9+/-0.9)x1020 cm-2 (consistent with
the Galactic value of NH=4.8x1020 cm-2, Dickey & Lockman 1990)
and a relatively low NH_host=(9.2+/-0.4)x1020 cm-2. The best
fitting power law photon index is Gamma=2.09+/-0.01.
The RGS spectrometers do now show any clear evidence of absorption
or emission lines in the 0.3-2 keV energy range.
The observed flux is of 9.5x10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 in 0.3-10 keV;
the corresponding unabsorbed flux is of 1.2x10-11 erg cm-2 s-1.

In addition, S1 is 3.9"" from the edge of the revised XRT error
circle (Racusin et al. GCN 5774). The most likely conclusion
is that S1 is not associated with the GRB.

There is no evidence for other sources inside the revised XRT
error circle. The limiting magnitude of our first epoch
observation is R > 25.1 (2 sigma). The corresponding upper limit
on beta_OX is 0.42, rendering the burst dark according to the
definition proposed by Jakobsson et al. (2004, ApJ, 617, L21).

Considering the brightness of S1, it is unlikely that it is a
normal galaxy if z ~ 3.3 (GCN 5698). The relatively low S/N of
the VLT spectrum makes it difficult to reach a firm conclusion
on the reality of absorption features (apart from the feature
around 5230 A). The lack of broad emission lines and the
marginal evidence for optical variability might indicate that
S1 is a blazar. An alternative scenario is that S1 is at a lower
redshift. The 5230 A feature could be the Balmer/4000 A break,
indicating a redshift of z ~ 0.3.

updated teldef file as described by Burrows et al. in GCN Circ. 5750).  
This is 4.0 and 0.7 arcsec from the original XRT and UVOT positions (GCN
Circ. 5823) respectively.

Because the BAT triggered on a pre-cursor, XRT was on target for the main
burst. The detected emission peaked at ~74s after the trigger, at a count
rate of ~2400 count s^-1 (corrected for pile-up). After 200s, the decay
follows a slope of alpha_1 = 0.36 +/- 0.07, until about 3ks after the
trigger, when the decay steepens to alpha_2 = 1.4 +/- 0.4.

The Windowed Timing mode data between 200 and 600s after the trigger
(i.e., when the data are clearly no longer piled-up) can be fitted with a
photon index of 2.25 +/- 0.12, with a total absorbing column of 2.3e21
cm^-2; comparison with the PC data from orbit 2 shows no further spectral
evolution. This absorption is significantly in excess of the Galactic
value of 5.1e20 cm^-2. Taking the redshift to be 1.314 from the Keck
measurement (GCN Circ. 5826; Bloom, Perley & Chen), the excess NH is
equivalent to a value of 9.6e21 cm^-2 in the rest-frame of the burst. The
observed (unabsorbed) flux for this spectrum is 2.51e-10 (3.81e-10) erg
cm^-2 s^-1.

If the decay continues with a slope of alpha = 1.4, the estimated count
rate at 24 hours is 0.031 count s^-1. This corresponds to an observed
(unabsorbed) flux of 1.19e-12 (1.80e-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

We have searched Milagro data for emission at GeV/TeV energies from GRB
070521 detected by Swift (GCN Circ 6431, C. Guidorzi et al.), during the
main period of emission lasting 60s (GCN Circ 6440, D. Palmer et al.).

No evidence for prompt GeV/TeV emission was found. TeV photons are
attenuated by pair production with infrared photons in intergalactic
space. We calculate an upper limit assuming two possible values for the
redshift: z=0.03 (GCN Circ 6433, E. O. Ofek et al.), and z=0.55 (GCN Circ
6444, T. Hattori et al.) using the extragalactic infrared background light
(EBL) absorption model of Primack et al. 2005 (AIP Conf. Proc. 745, p.
23).

A preliminary analysis, assuming a differential photon spectral
index of -2.4, gives upper limits on E^2dN/dE at 99% confidence of:

E^2 dN/dE at 250 GeV < 3.5 * 10^(-7) erg cm^(-2) (Assuming z=0.03)

and

E^2 dN/dE at 200 GeV < 5.5 * 10^(-6) erg cm^(-2) (Assuming z=0.55)

The energies quoted represent the approximate median energy of the
events that would be detected assuming a power law spectrum with
differential index -2.4 convolved with the absorption model.
These upper limits are preliminary and will be refined with further
analysis.",z=0.55,GRB 070521,Milagro,Spectroscopic

report:

On the night of 2007-04-16 (UT) we performed imaging on the field of 
GRB070412 (GCN 6273), the long burst located approximately 45"" in 
projection from a nearby early-type galaxy (GCN 6275), using Keck I 
(/LRIS) under poor seeing conditions.  We acquired a total of 113 
minutes of usable exposure time in I-band and 132 minutes in V-band, 
with a mid-exposure time of approximately 11:27 UT, 106 hours after the 
BAT trigger.

Using the astrometrically-corrected XRT position [1] (RA=12:06:10.18, 
dec=+40:08:35.3, uncertainty=2.2""), we observe a faint source at the 
edge of the uncertainty region in I-band.  This source is not detected 
in V-band.  Calibrating with respect to nearby stars from SDSS, we 
calculate a magnitude of:

I = 24.6 +/- 0.3

The V-band limiting magnitude is V > 26.5.

We note that the same source is also apparent in LBT r' imaging from 
Prieto et al. (GCN 6374) in both their epochs of observation (2.8 hours
and 8.2 days after the burst), suggesting the source is not transient, 
in which case we place an I-band limiting magnitude of I > 25.0 on any 
transient source in the XRT error circle.  The red color is suggestive 
of a high-redshift potential host galaxy.  The LBT r' detection would 
place a firm upper limit on the redshift to be z < 5.9.

report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team.

starting 3295 seconds after the BAT trigger.    The UVOT finding chart 
was delayed  due to an Earth limb constraint.

 Dec(J2000) = -29 45 20.0
with an estimated 90% uncertainty of 0.5"".  

Because of a configuration problem, most subsequent UVOT images do not 
include the afterglow position, but there is a 3.5 sigma detection in a 
subsequent image taken with the UVW1 (2600 A) filter.      Magnitudes 
and 3 sigma upper limits are reported below.

The object has not faded significantly between both epochs, although

statement regarding its variability.

Combining our own data and all the available optical-NIR data (GCNs
6962, 6973, 6974, 6975, 6976, 6980, 6983) we have measured a
photometric redshift z~5, but with a 2-sigma confidence interval that
includes all values in the z=[0 ... 5.5] range.

An alternative explanation for all the available data is that of a
strongly reddened afterglow (detected as a fading source in the H- and
K-band images), having taken place in a galaxy at a significantly
lower redshift (detected in our deeper, bluer, R- and z-band
images). This model should be checked via spectroscopy of the putative
host galaxy.

ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB
071025 (Swift trigger 295301, GCN 6986, Pagani, et al.) and detected
an optical counterpart as reported in GCN 6987 (Rykoff, et al.).  We
have improved the photometry and recalibrated the images relative to
USNO-B1.0 R-band, which is significantly offset from the magnitudes in
USNO-A2.0 R-band.

 From our initial observations at T+80.3s we see the counterpart rise
to a peak of 17.3+/-0.2 at T+332s (midtime for a 40s coadd), and then
fade slowly over the next 1500 s.  At T+595s (midtime for a 280s
coadd) the magnitude is 17.6+/-0.1.  This integration is nearly
simultaneous with the NIR detections of H~13.8 (Covino, et al., GCN
6988) and J=14.95 (Bloom, et al., GCN 6989).

Although the ROTSE-III images are calibrated relative to R-band, the
unfiltered CCD has significant sensitivity redward of R.  Our
observations are thus consistent with a possible R-band dropout (Im,
et al., GCN 6991) and UVOT non-detection (Pangani, et al., GCN 6986).

We can assume that the intrinsic GRB spectrum as an R-J color of ~1,
and the reddening is entirely caused by the intergalactic medium
(IGM).  We then use the ROTSE-III magnitude and the integrated
ROTSE-III response curve convolved with the IGM absorption model of
Meiksin (2005) to estimate an upper limit on the burst redshift of
z~5.3 (for more details see Ruiz-Velasco, et al, 2007).  We note that
at this redshift the R-band offset would be ~1.2 mag, which may be
consistent with the limits of Im, et al.  However, if the reddening is
not caused by absorption in the IGM then the burst redshift may be
lower.",z~5.3,GRB 071025,ROTSE-IIIb,Photometric

Using this partial data set, the time-averaged spectrum from T-7.4 to T+56.6 sec

spectrum is 1.41 +- 0.19.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is

We must stress however, that we have downlinked data out to only T+180 sec

is further activity in this burst past T+180 sec, then the spectral and
temporal values used in this hi-z indicator test may change
and no longer fit the hi-z criteria.  We are publishing this preliminary

(U. Leicester) and J.R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC) report on behalf of 
the Swift-XRT team:

The Swift-XRT started observing GRB 080310 (trigger no. 305288,
Cummings et al. GCN 7382) at 2008-03-10 08:39:27.85 UT, 89s after the
trigger. The observation so far spans 3 snapshots, with Windowed Timing
mode data from T+95s to T+799s, and Photon Counting mode thereafter.

The best XRT position is the UVOT-enhanced position from Osborne et al.
(GCN 7394).

At first, the 0.3-10keV X-ray light curve decays from 39 count s^-1 at
T+95s to 18 count s^-1 at T+130s but then shows strong flaring
activity. An initial rebrightening occurs from about T+135s to T+420s,
reaching ~135 count s^-1 at approximate times of 200s, 250s, 280s and
350s after the trigger.  This is followed by a second flare from T+500
to T+620s, where it reaches a maximum of ~115 count s^-1 at T+565s.
Following the flaring activity, the X-ray light curve, thus far, shows
a slow decline out to the end of the third snapshot (T+1.0ks to
T+18.7ks), where it reaches a count rate of 0.1 count s^-1 with an
underlying decay slope of alpha~0.5.

The X-ray data also show strong spectral evolution during the flaring
intervals.  A 1.5-10keV/0.3-1.5keV hardness ratio reveals the X-ray
emission initially hardens from T+135s to T+200s as the light curve
rebrightens, at which point it remains approximately constant until
T+360s, before softening as the light curve decays.  Similarly, the
source hardens again during the second flare from T+500s to T+565s,
then softens as this flare declines.

A spectrum of the WT data from T+200s to T+360s, where the hardness
ratio is approximately constant, can be well fit by an absorbed
powerlaw with photon index 1.45 +/- 0.02 and column density of (7.0
+/- 1.0)e21 cm^-2 at the redshift of the burst (z=2.43, Prochaska et

which corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of 6.8e-9 erg cm^-2 s^-1. 
The counts to observed flux conversion factor at the time of
this spectrum is 4.9e-11 erg cm^-2 count^-1.

The PC mode data from the second snapshot (T+5.1ks to T+7.3ks) show a 
softer spectrum, with a photon index of 1.9 +/- 0.2 and column density 
consistent with the value determined above. The observed 0.3-10keV flux at 
this time is (1.1 +/- 0.1) e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and corresponds to a flux 
conversion factor of 4.7e-11 erg cm^-2 count^-1.

If the underlying powerlaw decay continues as is, we predict an XRT count 
rate of 0.05 count s^-1 at T+24hr, which corresponds to an observed 
0.3-10keV flux of 2.5e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

At 17:05:09 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080319D (trigger=306793).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 99.480, +23.933 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 37m 55s
   Dec(J2000) = +23d 56' 01""
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual with an image trigger, the prompt light 
curve does not not show any clear structure.  We will be able to tell more with 
the full data set. 

The XRT began observing the field at 17:07:36.9 UT, 147.5 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued, 
variable X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 99.47270, 23.94306
which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 06h 37m 53.45s
   Dec(J2000) = +23d 56' 35.5""
with an uncertainty of 3.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 44 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of
2.17e+21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005), so we cannot constrain the
redshift at this time using the relation from Grupe et al. (2007). A
summary of the promptly downlinked data is given at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/306793/. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White (160-650 nm)
filter starting 152 seconds after the BAT trigger. A possible afterglow 
candidate has been found in the initial data products, at a magnitude of 
~19 mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding
to E(B-V) of 0.19. The position of the tentative UVOT source is:

on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We obtained griz observations of the field of GRB 080320 starting
approximately 80 mins post-burst with Gemini-N/GMOS.  Conditions were
rather poor, with some cirrus, which reduced the depth of the images.
A 2nd epoch of i-band imaging was obtained 9 hours post-burst.

A fading point source is seen in both i-band images, somewhat outside
the enhanced XRT error circle (GCN 7479).  The position (J2000) of
this counterpart, with respect to nearby SDSS stars, is (to 0.25
arcsec in each coordinate):

 RA =  11 50 56.427
 dec= +57 09 23.90

The SDSS galaxy noted in GCN 7480 is about 3 arcsec away from the
counterpart, and therefore probably unrelated to it.

Preliminary photometry (again relative to SDSS field stars) gives
i'=22.9, and fading between the epochs of 0.37+/-0.03 mag. This
relatively slow rate of fading could indicate a contribution from a
host galaxy.  The counterpart is seen in the z-band, but is absent (or
very faint) in the r-band image with a limit of about r~24.  This red
r-i colour could be explained by a Lyman-alpha break if the redshift
is z~4.5 to 5.

and F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 5.2 ks of Swift XRT data for GRB 080413A (Beardmore et
al. GCN Circ. 7594), from T0+67 s to T0+21000 s. The first 186 s of data
were obtained in Windowed Timing (WT mode); the remainder in Photon
Counting mode. The best XRT position for this object is the
UVOT-enhanced position given in Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 7596).

The X-ray light curve is well fitted by a power-law decay, with an
initial decay slope of 2.87 (+/- 0.19) up to T0+175 (+23/-16) s, at
which point the decay shallows to a slope of 1.10 (+0.06/-0.07).

A spectrum obtained from all of the WT mode data can be modelled with an
absorbed power-law with a photon index gamma=3.12 (+0.16/-0.15). A
redshifted absorbing column of 1.53 (+0.43/-0.38) x 10^22 cm^-2, at a
redshift of z=2.433 (Thoene et al. GCN Circ 7602) is necessary in
addition to the Galactic column of 8.71 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux in this spectrum is
4.1 x 10^-10 (1.71 x 10^-9) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

If the source continues to decay at the present rate, we predict a count
rate of 3.51 x 10^-3 count/sec at T0+24 hours, which correponds to a
0.3-10 keV observed (unabsorbed) flux of 9.54 x 10^-14 (2.72 x 10^-13)

The data set consists of 376 s exposure in Windowed Timing (WT) mode 
followed by 9.5 ks exposure in Photon Counting (PC) mode.

By using orbits 2-4 of PC data [from T0+6.0 ks to T0+20.1 ks]
in order to avoid pile-up effects, we derive an XRT refined position 

     RA (2000) = 21h 44m 34.43s  = 326.1435 d
     Dec (2000) = -19d 58' 52.9"" = -19.9814 d

with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcsec (90% containment). This position
is 3.6 arcsec from the UVOT candidate afterglow (GCN Circ. 7598), 
and 3.4 arcsec from the source reported in Kruehler et al. (GCN Circ.
7599).

The X-ray light curve is well fitted by a simple power-law, with a 
decay slope of 0.88 +/- 0.06.

A spectrum obtained from the WT mode data, from T0+135 s to T0+511 s,
can be modelled with an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 
2.05 +/- 0.10 , and a redshifted absorbing column of (0.32 +/- 0.13) 
x 10^22 cm^-2 at a redshift of z=1.1 (Vreeswijk et al. GCN Circ 7601) 
in addition to the Galactic column of 3.06 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et 
al. 2005). The observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux in this spectrum is
1.79 x 10^-10 (2.13 x 10^-10) erg/cm^2/s. 
The PC spectrum of the first four orbits, from T0+512 s to T0+20.1 ks, 
can be fit by an absorbed power-law model with photon index 1.93 +/-
0.08 and a column density consistent with the WT spectrum. 
All the reported errors are at the 90% confidence level.

If the source continues to decay at the present rate, we predict a count
rate of 0.035 count/sec at T0+24 hours, which corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV 
observed (unabsorbed) flux of 1.6 x 10^-12 (1.8 x 10^-12) erg/cm^2/s.

We have analysed the first five orbits of data obtained for GRB 080516 
(Holland et al., GCN Circ. 7733), covering 11.5 ks of Photon Counting (PC) 
mode data. The UVOT-enhanced XRT position was given by Beardmore et al. in 
GCN Circ. 7735.

The light-curve begins relatively flat, with a decay of alpha ~ 0.36 +/- 
0.17, until around 4800 seconds after the trigger, at which point the 
slope steepens to 1.04 +0.20/-0.18. 

The first five orbits of PC data can be modelled with an absorbed 
power-law, with Gamma = 2.7 +/- 0.4 and total NH = (1.3 +/- 0.3)x10^22 
cm^-2, considerably in excess of the Galactic value of 3.22x10^21 cm^-2. 
Using the relation in Grupe et al. (2007, ApJ, 133, 2216), this implies an 
estimated upper limit on the redshift of the burst of z<1.0. There is no 
evidence for spectral evolution across the temporal break. The observed 
(unabsorbed) flux over this time interval (90-2.5x10^4 s after the 
trigger) is 2.38x10^-12 (1.06x10^-11) erg cm^-2 s^-1. The counts to 
observed flux conversion is 5.8x10^-11 erg cm^-2 count^-1.

If the light-curve continues to decay at alpha ~ 1.04, the count rate at 
24 hours is predicted to be 3.7x10^-3 count s^-1, corresponding to an 
observed flux of 2.1x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

We observed the field of GRB 080523 (Stroh et al., GCN 7767) with the 
ESO VLT equipped with FORS2. Photometric observations were conducted on 
2008 May 24, between 8:14 and 8:27 UT (about 10.9 hr after the GRB). 
Inside the revised XRT error circle (Osborne et al., GCN 7768), we 
detect a faint source at coordinates (J2000):

RA = 01:23:11.61
Dec = -64:01:51.8

Lacking any information on variability, we cannot assess whether this 
source is associated with GRB 080523.

A spectrum of the object shows detection of continuum in the blue down 
to 4200 AA, implying a redshift limit z < 2.5. Further analysis is underway.

We note the presence of two further, faint sources close to, but 
slightly outside of, the refined XRT error circle at (RA, Dec) = 
(01:23:11.21, -64:01:53.9) and (01:23:10.88, -64:01:50.4).

     We have used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on
the Hubble Space Telescope to image the host galaxy of GRB 980329.  We
obtained 8072 seconds of STIS/CCD images with the 50CCD (clear)
aperture and 5416 seconds with the F28X50LP (long pass) aperture.
This data was taken as part of the Survey of the Host Galaxies of
Gamma-Ray Bursts (Holland et al., GCN 698) approximately 880 days
after the burst occurred.  Combined images are now available at
""http://www.ifa.au.dk/~hst/grb_hosts/data/index.html"".  The drizzled
F28X50LP image is based on two orbits worth of data, and will be
updated when the data from the third orbit is available.

       A preliminary determination of the location of the radio
transient VLA J070238.0+385044 associated with GRB 980329 (Taylor et
al. 1998, ApJL, 502, L115), based on the astrometry of three USNO-A2.0
stars, is (X,Y) = (1039,1027) where the three-sigma uncertainty in the
astrometric solution is 20 drizzled STIS pixels (0.5 arcsec).  There
is a faint, extended object at (X,Y) = (1031,999) in our drizzled
50CCD image.  This object is also visible in the F28X50LP image.  The
object is approximately three sigma southwest of the position of the
GRB, and is the best candidate for the host galaxy of GRB 980329.  An
image showing the location of the galaxy and the GRB is available at
""http://www.ifa.au.dk/~hst/grb_hosts/data/grb980329cd.gif"".  The
probable host galaxy has AB magnitudes, in an aperture of radius 0.25
arcsec, of CL = 28.6 +/- 0.3 and LP = 28.1 +/- 0.3.  If we assume that
the galaxy has a power-law spectrum then the preliminary Kron-Cousins
R-band magnitude is R = 27.7 +/- 0.3.  We also derived a preliminary
calibration based on two stars from Rhoads et al. (GCN 157) and found
R = 28.2 +/- 0.3.  These results are consistent with each other, and
are consistent with the host magnitude being 26.8 < R < 29, as
determined by Gorosabel et al. (1999, A&A, 347, L31) from the decay of
the optical light curve.  The faintness of the galaxy is consistent
with it having a redshift of z > 2 (Fruchter 1999, ApJ 512, L1; Lamb

observations started on 10.9899 Aug (10.59 hours after the burst),
when we measure an R-band magnitude of 19.1+/-0.2 (based on
USNO-1B photometry). This  value is in agreement with the slope
decay measured by Rykoff (GCN 8084) implying that no break has
been produced between both observations. This is also consistent
with the magnitudes reported by Burenin et al. (GCN 8088). We

The object is seen in g' band, implying a redshift smaller than 3.5 and no

""We imaged the optical counterpart of GRB 081007 (Baumgartner et al., GCN

24.02, Nov 2.01, and Dec 5.04 UT corresponding to 16.80, 25.79, and 58.82
days after the burst, respectively.

Using the ISIS image subtraction package and adopting our third epoch as a
template image, we find a residual source in the first and second epochs
at a position coincident with that of the early afterglow.  A comparison
of the residual flux indicates that the transient increased by roughly 0.4
mag in i-band between the first and second epochs and then subsequently
faded.  We attribute this photometric evolution to a supernova component,
in line with the recent report of spectroscopic evidence for an underlying
Type Ibc supernova (Della Valle et al., CBET 1602).

Accounting for a redshift of z=0.53 (Berger et al., GCN 8335), the
k-corrected absolute magnitude of the object in our second epoch i-band

The optical/NIR source inside the XRT errorcircle, previously reported

The quoted error is statistical only. There is an additional 
systematic error in the absolute calibration using the GROND zeropoint 
which is expected to be in the 0.2 mag range. As the GROND photometric 
system is based on the SDSS in g'r'i'z' these values are AB magnitudes.

The complete light curve obtained during the first night post burst 
can be reasonably well described with a power law of index 1.1 +- 0.2.

A broad band SED from g' to K was constructed using data obtained 
simultaneously at a midtime of 1500 s after the trigger. After 
correcting for a Galactic foreground extinction corresponding to a 
reddening of E_(B-V)= 0.16 (Schlegel et al. 1998), the r' to K band 
SED is well described with a power law of spectral index beta = 0.85 
+- 0.15.

We tentatively associate the large, foreground extinction corrected 
g'-r' color of around 1.4 mag with Ly-alpha absorption in the host at 
a redshift of 3.8 +- 0.4. This photometric redshift estimate has been 
obtained using hyperZ (Bolzonella et al. 2000). We caution, however, 
that this might be subject to changes due to a future improved 
calibration.",3.8 +- 0.4,GRB 081228,GROND,Photometric

An afterglow, consistent with the enhanced XRT position (Beardmore et

quickly fades (with alpha ~ 0.9 +/- 0.2 in white filter) below detection 
limits. The initial magnitudes (or 3 sigma limits) are:

We report on further analysis and new observations of the optical afterglow 
candidate of GRB 090118 (Copete et al. 2009, GCN #8825).

We re-analyzed our first epoch images (Olivares et al. 2009, GCN Circ. 8826),
taken at about 11 hrs after the GRB. No source is seen in our NIR images at 
the position of the X-ray afterglow (Rowlinson et al. 2008, GCN Circ. 8828),
giving upper limits (Vega system) of 

J > 20.6 
H > 19.6  
K > 18.7  

calibrated against 2MASS field stars.

The XRT position (Rowlinson et al. 2009, GCN  Circ. 8828) is outside of the 
field-of-view of the g'r'i'z' detectors, so no statement can be made on
the optical brightness during our first epoch.

We observed the field of GRB 090118 again with GROND on 2009-01-22 at a
mid-time of 01:30 UTC, about 100 hours after the burst. We clearly detect 
the candidate mentioned by Updike and Hartmann (2009, GCN Circ. 8829) in 
our optical filters, but not in the NIR:

g'= 23.46 +- 0.11 (AB)
r'= 23.27 +- 0.10 (AB)
i'= 22.95 +- 0.12 (AB)
z'= 22.25 +- 0.14 (AB)
J > 21.5 (Vega)
H > 20.5 (Vega)
K > 19.6 (Vega)

No correction for the foreground extinction of E(B-V)=0.135 mag
has been applied.

Comparing our g'r'i'z' values with the J and H detections of Updike & Hartmann 
(2009a; GCN Circ. 8829) and Minowa et al. (2009; GCN Circ. 8832) about two
days earlier, we find that the spectral energy distribution is smooth, thus 
supporting the non-fading nature of this object as indicated already by the
results of Updike & Hartmann (2009b; GCN Circ. 8831) and Minowa et al. 
(2009; GCN Circ. 8832).

The detection in g'r'i'z' implies that the object, whatever its nature, 
is at a redshift smaller than 3.5.

This excludes the possibility that this object is at high redshift and
exhibited a long plateau phase. The plateau phase would have to last more 
than 3 days in the NIR range, while at X-rays a steady decline has been 
seen (Rowlinson & Page 2009, GCN Circ. 8840). We conclude that this object 
is very likely not the optical/NIR afterglow of GRB 090118. Instead, the
object's SED is consistent with a low-redshift galaxy.",No Redshift,GRB 090118,GROND,No Information

Melipal telescope of the Paranal Observatory. X-shooter is the first
of the second-generation VLT instruments and includes three
Echelle spectrographs, the Ultraviolet/Blue (UVB), the Visible (VIS)
and the Near Infrared (NIR), which combined provide a fixed spectral
format and cover in one shot the spectral range 3000 - 24000 A at
medium spectral resolution (R = 4000 - 10000 depending on the arm
and slit width). The mean epoch of the observation was 45.3 hours
after the burst, when the afterglow had faded to R ~ 21.6 (Perley et
al. GCNC 9001; Cobb et al. GCNC 9008). In the 4 x 1500 s combined
spectrum we clearly detect continuum above 5580 A with several
absorption lines; below this, the signal is dominated by background
emission produced by the nearby Moon (90 % illumination at 37 deg
from the field). The spectrum indicates an absorption redshift
of z = 3.3721  0.0004 (consistent with that measured by Chornock et
al., GCNC 8994 and Thoene et al., GCNC 9012) through the detection of
Si II (1304.5), C II (1334.5), Si IV (1393.8), Si IV (1402.8), Si II

Mg II (2796.3, 2803.5) and Mg I (2853.0). The intervening system
identified by Thoene et al. (GCNC 9012) is resolved into multiple
components through the detection of Fe II, Mg II and Mg I lines with
its main absorption at redshift 1.800. A further system at z = 1.959
shows Fe II, Mg II and Mg I absorption.

The spectra of GRB 090313 will be made public on the ESO web as other

mode from T+219 s to the end of the observation at T+18 ks.

The best position of the X-ray afterglow is the UVOT enhanced XRT
position given in Goad, et al., GCN Circ. 9154, that is
RA, Dec = 269.31329, +33.40607 which is equivalent to:

Dec (J2000): +33d 24' 21.8""

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The 0.3-10 keV X-ray light curve is well fitted by a doubly broken
pawer law, with a initial decay slope alpha1=1.7+/-0.1,
a first breal at about T+245 s, an intermediate decay slope
alpha2=0.35 -0.1+0.06, a second break at about T+2 ks and
a final decay slope alpha3=1.39+/-0.06
If decaying at this rate, the afterglow will reach a count-rate of
6.1E-3 counts/s at T+48h.

The average WT spectrum (corresponding to the initial steep decay phase)
is best fitted by an absorbed power-law model, with photon index 2.0+/-0.2,

We detect in the spectrum flux at wavelengths lambda>1.1 microns, and a

as the onset of Lyman alpha absorption in the IGM, this leads us to 
deduce a value of z~8.1.

The large g-i color as compared to r-i indicates that the Lyman break may
be located in the g' band. Fitting the SED with Hyper-Z results in a 
preliminary photometric redshift of z = 3.9+0.4-0.7, assuming no intrinsic

We observed the field of GRB 090709A (Morris et al. GCN 9625)
with MOIRCS on Subaru Telescope in J and K bands under a
cirrus condition, starting at ~9:30 UT on July 9, approximately
2 hours after the burst.
We detected following two objects near the XRT error circle.
Their preliminary magnitudes based on a nearby 2MASS star are following.

object A:  J(Vega)=19.0, K(Vega)=18.2
object B:  J undetected, K(Vega)=18.6

We placed the K band finding chart at

http://www.hp.phys.titech.ac.jp/nkawai/grb/090709/GRB090709.jpg

We further performed spectroscopy for them with the following results:

Object A: zJH spectroscopy, a flat spectrum with no break detected.

Object B: HK and zJH spectroscopy, a continuum detected in K-band,
   no continuum detected in J band, 
   possibly no continuum in H-band but with high background.

Lack of H band continuum could suggest that the object B is at high 
redshift (z~10), though its poor SNR does not allow us to confirm it.
Fading is not confirmed for either of them.

Further NIR/optical observations are strongly encouraged.",No Redshift,GRB 090709A,Subaru Telescope,"No Information.

Berkeley) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB090709A (Morris et al., GCN 9625) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations began at 7:40:26 UT on
9 July 2009 (~ 2 minutes after the burst trigger) and were taken in the
r', i', and z' filters.

We marginally detect a faint source at the location of the NIR afterglow
(Aoki et al., GCN 9634, Morgan et al., GCN 9635) in our first r' and z'
images.  However, nothing is detected at this location in subsequent
images or deeper coadditions at later times.  We therefore cannot
entirely rule out that these represent chance statistical fluctuations.

We report the following photometry and upper limits (referenced with
respected to the USNO-B1 catalog):

The r' and z' detections, if real, would argue strongly in favor of a low
or moderate redshift origin with a large extinction column in the GRB host
galaxy (Butler, GCN 9639).  A combined fit of approximately co-eval
PAIRITEL (GCN 9635, Morgan et al.) and P60 photometry assuming moderate
redshift (z < 4) is consistent with a highly dust-extinguished (A_V > 2
mag) power-law spectral energy distribution.

9801,2009-08-14 13:33:54.000,"GRB 090814A: Swift-XRT Team Refined AnalysisK.L. Page (U. Leicester) & T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf of 
the Swift-XRT team: 

We have analysed the first four orbits of data collected for GRB 090814A, 
from 165 s to 25.7 ks after the BAT trigger. These data comprise 258 s in 
Windowed Timing (WT) mode and 7.8 ks in Photon Counting mode. The enhanced 
XRT position for this burst was given by Beardmore et al. in GCN Circ. 
9796.

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays, 
starting with alpha1 = 2.60 +/- 0.08 until ~T+830 s, at which point the 
decay flattens slightly to alpha2 = 1.91 +/- 0.20. The light curve 
flattens again at ~T+5.4 ks, to a slope of alpha3 = 0.51 +/- 0.48. With 
the limited data at this time, alpha3 has a relatively large uncertainty.

The spectrum extracted from the WT data can be fitted with an absorbed 
power-law, with Gamma = 2.78 +0.12/-0.11, absorbed by the Galactic column 
of NH = 4.76 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005), together with an 
intrinsic column (assuming z = 0.696; Jakobsson et al., GCN Circ. 9797) of 
(2.0 +/- 0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2. Note, however, that this redshift 
determination is uncertain. The total (including Galactic) column at z = 0 
would be (1.3 +/- 0.2) x 10^21 cm^-2. Alternatively, the spectrum is 
better fitted (at >3 sigma) by a broken power-law with Gamma1 = 0.47 
+0.72/-1.59 below a break energy of 0.62 +0.09/-0.08 keV, followed by 
Gamma2 = 2.62 +/- 0.09; this fit only requires the Galactic column. The 
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced 
from the broken power-law fit is 2.5 x 10^-11 (3.0 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 
count^-1.

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of 
0.51, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.0041 count s^-1, 
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.0 x 10^-13 
(1.2 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
