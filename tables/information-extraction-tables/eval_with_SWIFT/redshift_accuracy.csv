1,"UntitledThe BATSE team report a change to the LOCBURST procedure:

The BATSE-RBR location of GRB970925 had a larger-than-average systematic
location error and was inconsistent with the IPN annulus.  The reprocessed
location, however, using the full data set, is entirely consistent with the IPN
annulus.  The RBR team has determined the cause of the error and, although they
could not have anticipated it, we now have a procedure in place to check for
similar problems in future events.  While this will add time to the location
processing, we feel it will minimize the chances that future problematic events
will be distributed via GCN/RBR.  As a result of this new filtering process, a
bright BATSE trigger might not automatically be followed by a locburst notice.",No Redshift,0.692,No Information,GRB970925,No Information,Swift,No Information,Spectroscopic,1970-01-01 00:00:00.000

On 17 December UT, we observed the candidate optical counterpart to GRB
971214 that was reported by Halpern, Thorstensen, Helfand, Costa, et al
(IAU Circular 6788).  We used the Kitt Peak National Observatory 0.9
meter telescope with a Harris I band filter.  The transient source is
seen in the clipped average of forty-four 300 second exposures, though
it is quite near the detection limit.  We also detect the two nearby
faint sources that are reported by Kulkarni et al and apparent in the R
band images by Diercks et al.  The brighter of the two is clearly
nonstellar in our data.  The observations spanned the period  UT 08:55
to  13:18 on 971217.  The point spread function of the final image has
approximately a 2 pixel (approx 1.6 arcsec) full width at half maximum.

Photometry with a 2 pixel (approx 1.6 arcsec) radius aperture yields
an I magnitude difference of +4.4 +- 0.4 magnitudes between the optical
transient and to the bright star ~ 26 arcseconds SSW of the transient.

Other magnitudes relative to this same reference star are
 -2.52 +- 0.015   Bright star ~ 26 arcsec NE of transient;
 +0.33 +- 0.02    Bright star ~ 55 arcsec NW of transient;
 +4.35 +- 0.35    Fainter nearby fuzzball, ~ 5 arcsec N of transient; 
 +3.48 +- 0.15    Brighter nearby galaxy, ~ 5.5 arcsec SW of transient;
 +3.15 +- 0.15    same object, but comparing 3 pixel radius apertures.
We do not have absolute photometric calibration for our data.
A crude estimate suggests that the 3 sigma limiting magnitude of the data
set ought to be in the range 23 < I < 24.

the 3rd Interplanetary Network, resports:

We have obtained a slightly refined, but still preliminary IPN
annulus for GRB980611 (BATSE 6816).  The annulus is centered at
RA(2000)=330.015 degrees, Dec(2000)=-10.611 degrees, and has
a radius of 79.520 +/- 0.029 degrees.  This annulus intersects
the LOCBURST error circle, but the two RXTE sources lie outside
the annulus by 0.66 and 0.81 degrees.  Therefore it is highly
unlikely that either is related to the GRB.  An image may be
found at http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/980611/.

CFHT Multi Object Spectrograph in imaging mode at the Cassegrain
focus of the 3.6-m CFH Telescope on the night of Feb. 28 to March 1.

Two 10 mn images were obtained in much better conditions than
the night before (GCN #998) with a seeing of about 0.8"".  There are
only a few point like sources in the vicinity of the OT. A star like
object ~11"" S of the OT has been carefully measured with respect
to the two stars used in GCN #998 and has a very consistent R
magnitude on the MOS exposures (R = 20.13 +/- 0.02). A fainter
object 8"" from the OT is used for internal consistency checks at
R = 22.35.

Precise reduction of the images from Feb. 28 and March 1 gives the
following results:

Feb. 28.653 UTC   R = 22.73 +/- 0.10
Mar. 01.628 UTC   R = 22.96 +/- 0.10

The index of the power law decay given in GCN #998 is not 
significantly modified and found as 1.25 +/- 0.06.

There is not structure found on the OT, which is still seen as a 
point source on the March 1 combined image.

10000,"GRB 090904A: afterglow confirmationDaniele Malesani (DARK/NBI), Pall Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland), and Ilya 
Ilyin (AIP), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed again the field of GRB 090904A (Perri et al., GCN 9879) with 
the NOT equipped with StanCam. Observations were carried out in the R 
band, for a total exposure time of 30 min, with a mean time September 
6.218 UT (2.176 days after the GRB trigger).

The object identified in our previous epoch of imaging (Malesani et al., 
GCN 9884) has clearly faded and is hardly detectable, if at all. A faint 
source is visible at its position, with magnitude R = 24.0 +- 0.3. If 
real, the inferred decay slope is alpha = 0.55 +- 0.12, assuming F(t) 
propto t^-alpha. The value of alpha is shallower than usually found at 
late times, and may indicate some host contribution or an unusual light 
curve.

The position of the transient is consistent with the latest available 
UVOT-enhanced XRT position (Goad et al., GCN 9885; see also 
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/index.php). We thus identify the 
object as the optical afterglow of GRB 090904A.

centered on RA 19h 54m 40.51s , Dec -22d 32m 17.36s was imaged; no new 
sources were detected using visual comparison of the CCD image with the 
DSS2 R-band plate of the area.

A stacked, 10 x 120-second image was also created from subsequent images 
of the field using the same camera.  The midpoint of this image was 2009 
October 10 11:47 UT, approximately 9.0 hours after the burst.  This image 
was visually examined, and no candidate objects were found; the image 
extends to approximately the same depth as the DSS2 red plate.

Using 3934 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 4 UVOT images, we find an
astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and
matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 298.66550,
-22.51820 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  19 54 39.72
Dec (J2000): -22 31 05.7

with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This is consistent
with the position of the candidate optical afterglow seen by GROND (Rossi et al.
GCN Circ. 10008).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans

triggered Konus-Wind at T0=09788.232 s UT (02:43:08.232).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure with a total
duration of ~8 s. The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available
at http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB091010_T09788/

had a fluence of (9.4  1.1)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0 + 2.240s
of (8.3  1.0)x10-6 erg/cm2/s

the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.20 (-0.28, +0.35),

RXTE observations taken at the time of the SuperAGILE detected burst GRB 
091010 (Donnarumma et al., GCN Circ. 10004; Feroci, GCN Circ 10005) also 
recorded the event.

The RXTE PCA detected two strong flares in emission, the first coinciding 
with the SuperAGILE trigger time (02:43:09 UT) and the other 2s later. 
Each flare lasted ~1s. There is also evidence for a third weaker flare 5s 
after the trigger. Peak count-rate (2-60 keV, 0.1s binning) for the first 
flare is 250 counts/s, and for the second flare is 500 counts/s.The RXTE 
lightcurve can be found at

http://staff.science.uva.nl/~pgcasell/GRB091010

At the time RXTE was observing XTE J1751-305, with nominal pointing 
direction

RA(J2000) = 17h 51m 13.49s
Dec(J2000) = -30d 39' 23.4""

so was approximately 28 degrees off-axis from GRB 091010. For this reason 
spectral and timing information will be degraded.Preliminary timing 
analysis reveals no significant periodic variability.The flares are not 
detected strongly below 30 keV.

Although bright, this GRB did not have an exceptionally high peak flux. 
It is therefore perhaps a little surprising that RXTE was able to record 
this event so strongly given the offset angle.Reflections in the 
collimator may be responsible (see Laros et al. 1985).

triggered and located GRB 091010 (trigger 276835391 / 091010113),
which was also detected by SuperAGILE (Donnarumma et al., GCN 10004).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift-XRT position
(Margutti et al. 2009, GCN 10006 and Evans et al. 2009, GCN 10012).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 55.7 degrees.
Moreover, this burst was bright enough to result in
a Fermi spacecraft repointing maneuver.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 8.1 +/- 0.5 s (8-1000 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.128 s to T0+8.064 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.11 +/- 0.03 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 150 (+6/-5) keV
(C-stat 446 for 359 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.09 +/- 0.02)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.9 s in the 8-1000 keV band

(Donnarumma et al., GCN Circ. 10004; Feroci, GCN Circ. 10005) started
on 2009 Oct 10th at 14:48:26 UT. The XRT data set consists of 9 ks
exposure in PC mode. The UVOT-enhanced XRT position was given by
Evans et al. in GCN Circ. 10012.

The X-ray source reported by Margutti & Guidorzi, GCN Circ. 10006
has faded to a level of (2.4 +/- 1.0)e-3 count/sec, with a best fit
power-law decay index of alpha=-1.4 +/- 0.6 .
This source is thus confirmed as the afterglow of GRB 091010.

The spectrum extracted in the time interval 43-50 ks contains about
170 photons and can be fitted using an absorbed power law model.
Spectral channels have been grouped so as to have 5 counts per bin
and then weighted using the Churazov method (Churazov et al. 1996).
The best fit photon index is found to be 2.3 +/- 0.4. The spectrum
shows evidence of absorption at the level of (1.9 +/- 0.1)e21 cm-2,
in excess of the Galactic value in the direction of the burst which
is 8.1e20 cm-2, Kalberla et al. 2005.
The observed (unabsorbed) flux over this time interval is 1.5e-12
(2.8e-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV
flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum is 3.6 x 10^-11
(6.6 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1.

All quoted errors are at 90% confidence level.

A faint long GRB with duration of about 100 s has been detected by  
IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at 23:00:17 UTC on August 15th. No automatic  
alert has been issued because the trigger was at low significance.

RA:   306.13 [degrees]   DEC: -6.17 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The soft spectrum of the GRB (only detected in the 20-40 keV energy  
range) and the long, slowly rising light curve may indicate a highly  
redshifted burst. Follow-up observations at other wavelengths are  
encouraged.

At 20:48:19 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 091018 (trigger=373172).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 32.211, -57.526 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 08m 51s
   Dec(J2000) = -57d 31` 34``
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single smooth
FRED peak a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~16000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 20:49:20.5 UT, 60.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 32.18587, -57.54749 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 02h 08m 44.61s
   Dec(J2000) = -57d 32' 51.0""
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 91 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (2.81e+20
cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of 1.4
(+1.00/-0.93) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 4.40e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 68 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7`x2.7` sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	02:08:44.61 = 32.18588
  DEC(J2000) = -57:32:53.8  = -57.54827
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.61 arc sec. This position is 3.8
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
14.60 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.14. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.03.

Further observations of GRB 010222 made using the SCUBA sub-millimeter 
continuum bolometer array on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope now fail 
to significantly detect the counterpart described in GCN #971 and #996.

The observations, made between 14:54 and 18:05 on 2001 March 2 UT, give 
a preliminary 850 micron flux density of 0.7 +/- 1.1 mJy.  A 1-hour 
observation on the previous night is consistent with this result.

It thus appears as if the source detected earlier is not the quiescent 
host galaxy.  Indeed, of the 17 bursts studied with SCUBA to date, that 
have measured redshifts between 0.707 and 3.4, no conclusive detections
of quiescent sub-millimeter hosts have so far been found (Smith et al. 
1999, A&A, 347, 92; Smith et al. 2001, A&A, in press).

At least at 850 microns, GRB 010222 may be similar to GRB 980329, 
which also had an apparent excess in the SCUBA observations and whose 
sub-millimeter flux decayed rapidly with time (unfortunately, the first 
SCUBA observations were not made until 7 days after that burst).

At 21:36:44 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 091020 (trigger=373458).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 175.715, +50.972 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 11h 42m 52s
   Dec(J2000) = +50d 58' 19""
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a bright peak
with a second much smaller peak at T+30 s, for a total duration 
of about 45 sec.  The peak count rate was ~5000 counts/sec (15-350 keV),
at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 21:38:05.5 UT, 80.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, fading, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 175.7284, +50.9788 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 11h 42m 54.81s
   Dec(J2000) = +50d 58' 43.6""
with an uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 39 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 3.01e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 89 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	11:42:55.18 = 175.72993
  DEC(J2000) = +50:58:41.9  = 50.97831
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.74 arc sec. This position is 3.9
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
15.73 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.14. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.02.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-8.7 to T+38.3 sec is best fit by a simple

with a steeper power-law index of about -1.3 in BR between 12 hours and 1.5

However, between 1.5 days and 3.4 days after the trigger, the afterglow 
faded with a shallower power-law index of about -0.9 in R.

The I - R color of the afterglow, which brightened by about 0.45 mag

behalf of the Swift Team:

At 08:56:01 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 091024 (trigger=373674).  The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 339.207, +56.874 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 22h 36m 50s
   Dec(J2000) = +56d 52' 28""
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with the first peak at T=0 and a second smaller peak at T=40s 
with a total duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~5000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+50.0 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is F. E. Marshall (marshall AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov).

report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


""At 08:55:58.47 UT on 24 October 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) triggered and located GRB 091024 (trigger 278067360 / 091024372),
which was also detected by the Swift-BAT (Marshall et al. 2009, GCN 10062).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position. At
09:06:29.36, GBM triggered on what appears to be the continuation of this
burst (trigger 278067991 / 091024380).   The GBM on-ground location for 
this
second trigger is also consistent with the Swift position for GRB 091024.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the time of the
first trigger is 97 degrees and at the time of the second trigger
it is 14 degrees.  Furthermore, at 09:12:14.28, the Fermi spacecraft 
executed
a maneuver to place the burst near the center of the Large Area Telescope
(LAT) field-of-view and observe this region for 5 hours subject to
Earth angle constraints.

The first emission episode appears to last about 50 s, with 2 peaks 
separated
by a few seconds.  A brighter emission periods starts at the time of the 
2nd
trigger, 630 s later, and persists for at least 400 s.   This second 
emission period
shows an initial pulse (at 630 s) lasting about 40 s, followed by a 
multi-peaked
episode starting 210 s later (840 s from the first trigger) and lasting 
over 100 s. 
There is evidence for lower-level emission beyond this time.  The Fermi
spacecraft entered the South Atlantic Anomaly 2200 s after trigger 
091024380,
by which time there was no obvious emission in GBM.

In a first, preliminary analysis, we have fit time-integrated spectra 
for each of the
3 main emission blocks.  The first trigger appears to have an EPeak of 
about
400 keV;  the first peak of the second trigger is quite weak and best 
fit using
a power-law of index around -1.5;  the long and brighter emission period of
the second trigger has an EPeak of around 300 keV.  Detailed spectral
analyses and fluence values will be given in a future circular.

Swift-BAT triggers 373679-373684 are not real.  They are due
to false positive detections in image-trigger mode while the 
the spacecraft star tracker was in loss-of-lock.

There is filtering code within GCN to prevent distribution
of Swift notices for image triggers that occur during star tracker
loss-of-lock intervals, but sometimes this filtering gets confused
(e.g. when the BAT_Position message is not received at GCN, or when
the messages carry over into the next orbit).  Receiving these
notices can be confusing because many notices of the sequence
you normally receive are missing.

T90 (15-350 keV) is 109.8 +- 16.7 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-15.2 to T+135.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.20 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.1 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.

1008,"Support extension to the BeppoSAX missionDear colleague,

this message is to inform you about current plans to shut-down BeppoSAX by
April 30 this year, notwithstanding the excellent status and prospects of
the mission, and to solicit, if you agree, a statement of help and support
for the extension of BeppoSAX life for a further year.


All instruments and subsystems are performing satisfactorily and are stable.
The satellite has been operated for 4 years in 1 gyro mode and it is ready
to be operated in gyroless mode.  This mode has been successfully tested on
ground and on-board, and its performances are expected to be comparable to
the previous mode.  The orbital decay estimates predict that the critical
altitude of 450 km will not be crossed before April 2002 (worst case).

BeppoSAX is at present and for at least the next year the only satellite
able to observe extragalactic sources at hard X-rays and to follow
promptly and systematically GRB evolution.

The budget required to operate BeppoSAX for another year is about 1% of
the annual budget of the Italian Space Agency (ASI).

For these reasons the BSAX Steering Committee has requested to ASI, in
November 2000, the extension of BSAX operations from April 2001 to May
2002, planning to call for an AO5 completely open to the International
community.

(The proposal submitted to ASI, including the scientific case is available
at: www.ias.rm.cnr.it/sax/AO5/AO5Docs.html)


If you think that a suppression of BeppoSAX will impact negatively on the
development of High Energy Astronomy in the years 2001-2002 we ask you to
write a few lines that can be used to support actions causing ASI to
recede from the decision.

A statement on the impact of SAX results on the recent development of High
Energy Astrophysics and a statement on expectations from further BeppoSAX
results in your field of interest, could make your mail particularly
effective.

Please be aware that we will make a public use of the previous statements
(such as circulating or putting in a web site).

We are sending this message to various mailing lists and ask every
colleague to further circulate.  We apologize if you receive it more than
once.

Please, if you agree, send your message as an e-mail to the address

of the Swift Team:

At 13:11:30 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 091026 (trigger=373871).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 276.583, -86.121 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 26m 20s
   Dec(J2000) = -86d 07' 16""
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a FRED pulse
with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 13:12:48.9 UT, 78.7 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 276.59337, -86.11056 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 18h 26m 22.41s
   Dec(J2000) = -86d 06' 38.0""
with an uncertainty of 4.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 37 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (8.36e+20
cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of 3.6
(+2.72/-2.29) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 3.42e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 87 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.13.

report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 2.2 ks of XRT data for GRB 091026 (Markwardt et al. GCN
Circ. 10081), from 85 s to 6.8 ks after the BAT trigger. The data
comprise 326 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in Photon
Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given
by Evans et al. (GCN. Circ 10084).

The light curve shows three flares in the first snapshot, with peaks
at T0+180 s, T0+340 s and T0+~890 s. The orbital gap interrupts the
final flare, making its peak time somewhat uncertain. If these flares
are disregarded (i.e. fitting only the data from 85 s to 150 s and 2 ks to
6.8 ks), the underlying light curve can be modelled with an initial
power-law decay with an index of alpha=3.40 (+0.31, -0.26), followed by
a break at T+149 s to an alpha of 0.98 (+0.07, -1.7).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.97 (+/-0.08). The
best-fitting absorption column is 2.93 (+0.28, -0.27) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 8.4 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.01 (+0.18, -0.17)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 3.5 (+0.7, -0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2.
The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum is 4.6 x 10^-11 (7.6 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1.

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.98, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.018 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 8.3 x
10^-13 (1.4 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

We reported the BAT refined analysis based on the event-by-event

The field of GRB 010222 was imaged with the 1.8m Vatican Advanced
Technology Telescope (VATT) on 2001 March 18 and 19 (UT). The
total exposure time in R band was 3 hours in average seeing of 1.2"".
A faint source is detected within 0.2"" of the position of the optical
afterglow (GCN 961, 962). Using PSF fitting photometry we
find R=24.53+/-0.25 mag assuming the Henden calibration
of the nearby stars (GCN 987). The estimated magnitude is consistent
with the extrapolated light curve assuming a power-law with
index -1.33 (after the break at 0.7 days).

A number of galaxies are visible within 10"" of the afterglow. The
brightest is a compact galaxy with R=22 mag, 4.2"" (PA=10 deg) from the
GRB. Three faint galaxies, all 4"" from the afterglow have PA=280, 230,

Swift Team:

At 03:53:22 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 091029 (trigger=374210).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 60.183, -55.994 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 04h 00m 44s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 59' 37""
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~18 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 03:54:41.9 UT, 79.3 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 60.17774, -55.95574 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 04h 00m 42.66s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 57' 20.7""
with an uncertainty of 4.4 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 138 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of
1.14e+20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 1.80e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 


UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 90 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	04:00:42.58 = 60.17742
  DEC(J2000) = -55:57:20.0  = -55.95555
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.70 arc sec. This position is 2.3
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
20.31 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.18. No correction has been made for the

We have analyzed the first 7 orbits of  XRT data of GRB 091029
(Grupe et al. GCN Circ.  10097). The data comprise 69 s in Windowed
Timing (WT) mode and 15727 s in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The
enhanced XRT position has already been determined by Goad et al.
(GCN circ. 10102).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an
absorbed  power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.30+/-0.08
with an  absorption column density consistent with the Galactic
value of 1.14 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). The PC mode
spectrum (excluding the flare around 300 s after the burst) results
in a slightly flatter X-ray spectrum with Gamma = 2.00+/-0.07.

The light curve (excluding the flares) can be modelled with a
double broken power-law decay with an initial decay slope
alpha-1 = 3.76+0.21-0.19 with the first break at 358+48-31 s
after the trigger followed by a plateau phase with a decay slope
alpha-2 = -0.17+/-0.22 and a second break at 3640+3450-1270 s.
After this break the decay slope is alpha-3 = 0.76+0.06-0.05.
If the afterglow continues to decay with a slope of 0.76, the
predicted count rates 24, 48, and 72  hours after the trigger are
0.033 counts s^-1 or 1.12e-12 ergs s^-1 cm^-2,
0.020 counts s^-1 or 6.80e-13 ergs s^-1 cm^-2,

on behalf of the GROND team:


GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405), mounted at the 2.2m ESO/MPI 
telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chile), observed the field of GRB 
091109A (Oates et al., GCN #10138) simultaneously in the g'r'i'z'JHK bands.

Observations were done under clear sky conditions, starting on Nov 10 at 
00:07 UTC, 19.1 h after the burst and lasted for 1.8 hours.

In stacked images corresponding to a total integration time of 60 min in 
JHK and 75 min in g'r'i'z', we detect the optical afterglow (Oates et 
al., GCN #10138, Guidorzi et. al, GCN #10142) in the g'r'i'z' bands and 
obtain the following preliminary magnitudes and upper limits (all in the 
AB system):

g' = 24.5 +/- 0.1
r' = 23.6 +/- 0.1
i' = 23.4 +/- 0.1
z' = 23.3 +/- 0.2
J > 22.2
H > 21.8
K > 21.2

which were derived using the GROND zero points and 2MASS catalog field 
stars as reference. No correction has been made for the expected 
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.03 mag in the 
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).

Associating the blue g'-r' color with Lyman-alpha absorption in the host 
of the GRB, we obtain a photometric redshift of z = 3.5 +/- 0.4 assuming 
no intrinsic dust.

In addition, we triggered VLT/FORS2 spectroscopy, that started Nov 10 at 
02:23 UTC, 21.5 h post-burst. Two integrations of 1800 s each at a mean 
airmass of 2.1 were obtained using the 600RI grism that covers the 
wavelength range from 5300 to 8700 A.  In the low S/N spectrum we find a 
tentative ~60A EW broad absorption feature around a wavelength of 5700A. 
If associated with Lyman-alpha absorption, the corresponding redshift of 
~3.5 would be in agreement with the GROND photo-z.

We note, however, that all observations are also consistent with a host 
galaxy at a redshift of z ~ 0.44. Given the absence of information about 
a possible host galaxy contribution we cannot distinguish these two 
possibilities at this point.

galaxy was contained on the slit for these spectra.  Our second set,
starting immediately afterward, cover the wavelength range from 4500 -

slit.

From the nearby galaxy, we detect strong emissions features corresponding
to H-alpha, H-beta, and [O III] at a common redshift of z = 0.217.

The spectrum of the afterglow shows a strong break at ~ 6880 A, with
only faint continuum blueward of this feature.  Interpreting this as
the Lyman-alpha break, this correponds to a redshift of z ~ 4.7.  We
find marginal evidence for narrow absorption features corresponding to Si
II and Si II* at z = 4.65 redward of the break - however the relatively
low signal-to-noise ratio of our spectrum in this regime makes this result
somewhat uncertain.

Swift XRT observed GRB 100316D (Stamatikos et al. 2010, GCN10496)
in Windowed Timing (WT) mode in the 144-737 s time interval.
During this interval the light curve decays very slowly (decay
index alpha=-0.13, Starling et al. 2010, GCN 10505).
In addition, the 1.5-10 keV to 0.3-1.5 keV hardness ratio remains
constant (reduced chi2=0.91 with 97 degrees of freedom, dof).
Motivated by the high count rate (around 30 c s^-1, but far from
the pile up limit) and by the constant spectral shape we tried to
estimate the GRB redshift from the X-ray data.
We assume a Galactic column density of 7x10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et
al. 2005, A&A 440 775) and fit the WT spectrum taken from the
Leicester pages (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/00416135/)
with an absorbed (phabs*zphabs) cutoff power law model (the cutoff
power law model provides much better results in terms of column
density evaluation with respect to a simple power law model when
small spectral variations are present). Given the high count rate
we selected single pixel events only.
The resulting fit is good (reduced chi2=1.2, 333 dof). The redshift

10588,"Tentative redshift of GRB100413A from X-ray dataS. Campana (INAF-OAB), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and S. T. Holland
(CRESST/USRA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift XRT observed GRB 100413A (Holland et al. 2010, GCN 10581)
in Windowed Timing (WT) mode in the 146-550 s time interval.
During this interval the 1.5-10 keV to 0.3-1.5 keV hardness ratio slightly
decayed, testifying for small spectral variations.
We assume a Galactic column density of 7.3x10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et
al. 2005, A&A 440 775) and fit the WT spectrum with an absorbed
(tbabs*ztbabs) cutoff power law model within XSPEC (the cutoff power
law model provides much better results in terms of column density 
evaluation
with respect to a simple power law model when small spectral variations 
are present).
Data were grouped to have 30 counts per spectral bin. The resulting fit 
is good
(reduced chi2=0.9, 194 dof).
Filtering the data for single pixel events does not change the results.
In the intrinsic column density vs. redshift plane there is a low 
significance (3 sigma)
solution at low redshifts but the minimum lies at higher redshifts with 
a 2 sigma confidence
level solution of z=3.9+1.7-0.7 and N_H(z)=(5.5+9.8-2.1)x1022 cm-2.
Thus, even if we cannot exclude that GRB100413A is at low redshift, a 
high redshift (z~4),
highly absorbed (N_H(z)~6x1022 cm-2) solution is preferred.
This compares well with the non-detection with UVOT (Holland et al. 
2010) and
other robotic telescopes.

Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted on the 8 m Gemini North

GRB) and cover the wavelength range from 6000-10000 A.

The spectrum exhibits a strong break at approximately 7000 A which we
associate with a damped Ly-alpha system at z ~ 4.8.  We identify a series
of narrow absorption features redward of Ly-alpha, including O I 1302, Si
II 1304, C II 1334, C II* 1335, Si IV 1393, 1402, Si II 1526, and C IV

along with Ly-alpha forest continuum emission blueward of 7000 A, strongly
suggest this is the redshift of the GRB host galaxy.

The presence of the Ly-alpha break at 7000 A further explains the

10940,"Tentative redshift of GRB100704A from Swift-XRT dataS. Campana (INAF-OAB) and D. Grupe (PSU) report on behalf of the 
Swift-XRT team:

Swift XRT observed the bright GRB 100704A (Grupe et al. 2010, GCN 10929)
starting 86 s after the BAT trigger. After strong X-ray flares the light 
curve started decaying
following a power law (Grupe 2010, GCN 10935).
We selected the time interval 4,510-28,896 s after the burst onset to 
collect the Photon
Counting (PC) spectrum. During this interval the spectrum is almost 
constant as testified by
a constant power law photon index (chi2=102 with 123 degrees of freedom).

We fit the PC spectrum (comprising 2002 counts) with a (Galactic plus 
intrinsic) absorbed
cutoff power-law model (tbabs*ztbabs*cutoff) within XSPEC (the cutoff 
power-law model
provides much better results in terms of column density evaluation with 
respect to a simple
power-law model when small spectral variations are present).
We assume a Galactic column density of 1.1x1021 cm-2 (Kalberla et al. 
2005, A&A 440 775)
and allowed for a 30% variability given its high value (and sampling all 
the values obtained
within 1 degree from the source).
We fit the spectrum using C-statistics. In the intrinsic column density 
vs. redshift plane there
is a low significance (3 sigma) solution at low redshifts but the 
minimum lies at higher redshifts
with a 2 sigma confidence level solution of z=3.6^+1.1 _-1.2 and N_H 
(z)=(9.7^+9.9 _-5.6 )x10^22 cm^-2 .
Thus, even if we cannot exclude that GRB100704A is at low redshift, a 
high redshift (z~3.5),
highly absorbed (N_H (z)~1x10^23 cm^-2 ) solution is preferred.
This compares well with the non-detection with UVOT (Kuin and Grupe 
2010, GCN 10934)
and MOA robotic telescope (Omori et al. 2010, GCN 10931).
We also note that if no interviening systems are present along the line 
of sight a 90% lower
limit on the metallicity of 0.03 solar can be set (based on the 
assumption that the absorbing
medium is not Thomson thick).

The Swift/UVOT began observerving the field of GRB 100728B 101s
after the BAT trigger (Morris et al., GCN Circ. 11009). We detect the
optical afterglow in the white, v, b and u filters only.

The refined UVOT position is RA (J2000)= 163.48809, DEC  
(J2000)=-45.47265,
which is equivalent to:

      RA (J2000) = 02:56:13.467
     Dec (J2000) = +00:16:52.18

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.52 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position is consistent with the XRT refined position (Evans et  
al., GCN Circ 11017)
and with the optical afterglow positions reported by KAIT (Perley et  
al., GCN Circ 11007, 11010 & 11024),
PROMPT (Ivarsen et al., GCN Circ 11008, 11011) & the SON-NM

The non-detection in the UV filters suggests a photometric redshift of  
z~2.8.

galaxy continuum is not apparent below about 4700A, in part due to declining
detector quantum efficiency in the blue). Neither have we identified so far

Swift BAT triggered on the early activity of GRB 100902A (Sakamoto et 
al. 2010, GCN 11181). Swift XRT started observing 316 s after the 
trigger observing the main event. By using the Swift/XRT spectrum 
repository at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/ (see Evans et al. 
2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177) we selected two time intervals with an almost 
constant hardness ratio. These are at the end of the main event between 
500-550 s (in Window Timing, WT, mode) and the entire first orbit in 
Photon Counting (PC) mode (between 600-3000 s). We then fit the two 
spectra with XSPEC using the model tbabs*ztbabs (cutoff), keeping the 
same absorption pattern and leaving free the cutoff power-law model for 
the two spectra (the cutoff power-law model provides much better results 
in terms of column density evaluation with respect to a simple power-law 
model when small spectral variations are present).
We assume a Galactic column density of 1.1x1021 cm-2 (Kalberla et al. 
2005, A&A 440 775) and we allow for a 30% uncertainty in the fit.  We 
fit the spectrum using C-statistics. In the intrinsic column density vs. 
redshift plane there is just one deep minimum hinting for a redshift 
z=4.5^+0.3_-0.2 (90% confidence level) and an intrinsic column density 
N_H(z)=(2.3^+0.5_-0.3)x1023 cm-2. The X-ray spectrum is very soft with 
Gamma~3.9 at the end of the prompt phase (with a cut-off energy >17 keV) 
and with Gamma~1.9 and E_cut~5 keV in the PC spectrum. The two spectra 
indicate the same redshift even separately.
The high redshift and the large absorbing column density are in line 
with the non-detection with UVOT and other ground based optical facilities.

11009; Perley et al., GCN 11010) with the ESO VLT equipped with the
X-shooter spectrograph. The observation started on  2010-07-29 at 08:15
UT (22 hr after the GRB). A total exposure of 4x600 s was obtained,
covering the spectral range from 300 to 2500 nm. Due to technical
problems with the atmospheric dispersion corrector, the sensitivity of
the instrument was below the nominal value during this observation so
the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is very low.

In the spectra we detect a broad absorption line consistent with a
damped Lyman-alpha line and absorption features consistent with the MgII
doublet at a common redshift of z=2.106. Given the low S/N of the
spectrum, this redshift measurement should be considered tentative.

X-shooter GTO GRB collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 101219B (Gelbord et al., GCN 11473) 
with the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO-VLT UT2. Observations 
were taken on two epochs, 2010 Dec 20.17 and 2011 Jan 5.09 UT (11.6 hr 
and 16.4 days after the burst, respectively). Exposure times were 80 and 
120 min, respectively.

In the first-epoch spectrum, the afterglow is detected over the full 
spectral range from about 3200 to 22,000 AA. A careful analysis provides 
a tentative redshift z=0.5519 based on detection of weak Mg II and Mg I. 
No other clear features can be found at the same redshift either in 
absorption or emission.

The second-epoch spectrum was taken 16.4 days after the GRB, which 
corresponds to 10.6 days in the rest frame at z=0.55. The continuum is 
again detected, over the wavelength range 3500 to 22,000 AA, and is 
substantially redder. No narrow emission lines can be distinguished, but 
broad SN-like undulations are apparent, particularly around 8000 AA. We 
carried out a comparison of our spectrum with those of SN 1998bw (Patat 
et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 900) transformed at various redshifts. We find a 
convincing match at z~0.55 after comparing with a spectrum taken on 1998 
May 4 (i.e., 12 days after the GRB). The observed flux is consistent 
assuming a roughly equal contribution from a SN as bright as SN 1998bw 
and an underlying host galaxy. The match of the spectral shape, 
brightness, and spectral epoch together strenghten both the redshift 
determination and the existence of a SN associated with GRB 101219B.

Our findings are in good agreement with the GROND observations reported 
by Olivares et al. (GCN 11578).

covering the approximate wavelength range 0.3-2.5 micron. The slit
width was set to 1"", resulting in a resolving power range of

Preliminary reduction of the ultraviolet and visual parts of the

On April 4.58 UT (~60 minutes after the BAT trigger) 
we observed the field of GRB 120404A (Stratta et al., 
GCN 13208) using GMOS Spectrograph on the Gemini-North 
8-m telescope.  

The optical afterglow is clearly detected in our r-band 
acquisition image. 
We performed 2x900s spectroscopic observations of the 
optical afterglow using the B600 grating centered at 6500 
Angstrom (covering the range 5100-7900 A).
The spectrum reveals several absorption features, including 
FeII2586,2600, MgII2796,2803 at a common redshift of 1.633.
Other features indicate at least one MgII intervening system at
z=1.101

We therefore suggest that the redshift of GRB 120404A is z=1.633.

We thank the Gemini-North staff for their prompt support.",2.876,1.633,120404A,GRB 120404A,Gemini-North,Gemini-North 8-m telescope,Spectroscopic,Spectroscopic,2012-04-04 15:17:07.000

We observed the optical/NIR afterglow of the Swift GRB 120404A (Stratta et al., GCN 13208; Guidorzi et al., GCN 13209)  with the VLT/UT2 equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Observations started around 04:30 UT on 2012-04-05, which is roughly 16 hr after the trigger. 

In the acquisition frame (taken 15.9 hr after the GRB), the afterglow is detected at low S/N. Comparison with two closeby SDSS stars yields R ~ 21.3 (Vega), with a systematic uncertainty of ~0.3 mag.

Four exposures in a nodding pattern with an integration time of 2400 s each were obtained in poor sky conditions. The spectrum covers an approximate wavelength range between 3000 and 25000 AA. The slit width was set to 1"" in the ultra-violet/blue arm, and 0.9"" in the visual and near-infrared arms, resulting in a resolving power range of approximately 4500-7500.

Preliminary reduction of the spectrum shows a weak continuum with a trough at ~4720 AA, which we identify as Ly-alpha. We also detect faint absorption lines of OI 1302 and SiIV 1393/1402 at a common redshift of ~2.88. This confirms the redshift determination by Gemini-N (Cucchiara et al., GCN 13217). A second dip matching Lya at z=2.55 is also marginally detected. This is consistent with the CIV intervening absorber reported in Cucchiara et al., GCN 13217.

is about 8kpc, which would be a rather large offset for a long-GRB, but certainly possible.
If the galaxy is the host, then the absence of absorption lines in the afterglow spectrum
would not be too surprising, given the weakness of expected lines in the observed
wavelength range.  However, it would also make it one of the lowest

GTO collaboration:

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 120422A (Troja et al., GCN 
13243; Cucchiara et al., GCN 13245) with the ESO VLT equipped with the 
X-shooter spectrograph. Observations started on 2012 April 22.99 UT 
(16.5 hr after the GRB), for a total exposure time of 80 min in each of 
the UVB, VIS, and NIR arms, covering the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA. 
The slit was aligned so to cover both the galaxy at z = 0.28 present in 
the SDSS (Cucchiara et al., GCN 13245; Tanvir et al., GCN 13251) and the 
GRB optical counterpart (Cucchiara et al., GCN 13245).

We detect a plethora of nebular emission lines from the candidate host 
galaxy, including [O II], [O III], Balmer lines up to Hzeta, [N II], [S 
II], at a common redshift z = 0.283, thus confirming the results of 
Tanvir et al. (GCN 13251).

The trace of the GRB counterpart is rather blue (see also Nardini et 
al., GCN 13256), and we detect Mg II at z = 0.283 in absorption. No 
further absorption features are visible. We also note that the spatial 
extent of the brightest emission lines from the SDSS galaxy encompasses 
the position of the GRB counterpart, indicating nebular emission at z = 
0.283 at the GRB position.

While a chance superposition cannot be excluded, we note that the lack 
of absorption features at z > 0.283 would require a very tenuous 
environment at the GRB location. Furthermore, the UVOT detection in all 
the UV filters (Kuin & Troja, GCN 13248) implies a low redshift z <~ 
1.3. Last, we note that the UVOT photometry at t ~ 5 ks after the burst 
reveals a very blue spectrum, which is not typical of GRB afterglows, 
but is reminiscent of the very blue early emission of GRB 060218 
(Campana et al. 2006, Nature, 442, 1008). We thus conclude that the GRB 
is also likely at z = 0.283.

Using the gamma-ray fluence reported by Barthelmy et al. (GCN 13246), at 
z = 0.283 the isotropic-equivalent energy release of GRB 120422A is 
~4.4*10^49 erg, which is typical of local GRBs, often associated with 
supernovae. We encourage photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to 
detect the emergence of a supernova, or lack thereof.

Paranal, in particular Henri Boffin and Giovanni Carraro. We thank Nino 
Cucchiara for providing us with a finding chart from the Gemini

We detect several absorption features, including Ly-a, FeII, NiII, SiII,
SII, AlII, AlIII, CII, OI, CIV, ZnII all at a common redshift z = 3.93. In
particular, the presence of fine-structure lines (Fe II*, SiII*, OI*, OI**,
CII*) makes the redshift securely associated to the GRB.

We report on further analysis of the GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) optical/NIR imaging of the afterglow (Knust et al. GCN 13795, Klotz et al., GCN 13799, Yershov et al., GCN 13803, Kuin et al., GCN 13808) of GRB 120922A (Yershov et al., GCN 13793). Tying our photometric solution to field stars from the SDSS in the optical filters and 2MASS in the NIR, we derive the following AB magnitudes centered at a midtime of 00:01 UTC on September 23 (approx 1.5 hrs after the trigger):

g' = 20.53 +/- 0.05
r' = 19.69 +/- 0.04
i' = 19.44 +/- 0.04
z' = 19.28 +/- 0.04 
J = 18.92 +/- 0.06
H = 18.79 +/- 0.07
K = 18.63 +/- 0.10

After correcting these magnitudes for the expected Galactic foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_B-V = 0.15 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998), the SED is well fit with a simple power law of spectral index \beta = 0.5 +/- 0.2 and no strong evidence for host-intrinsic reddening. The significant drop in flux in the g'-band suggests a photometric redshift of 3.1 +/- 0.2, consistent with the lack of detection in the bluer UVOT filters (Kuin et al., GCN 13808).",3.1,3.1 +/- 0.2,120922A,GRB 120922A,MPG/ESO,GROND,Photometric,Photometric,2012-09-23 21:23:29.000

The spectrum exhibits two relatively broad troughs (centered at ~ 3800

respectively, at z=2.707. We measured the HI column density,
logN(HI)~21.7, from the Lyman-alpha feature. At this redshift there
are tentative indications of other metal absorption features, although
they are weak and we have yet to establish their significance. The
lack of strong resonance metal lines, together with the low X-ray
absorption (Sonbas et al., GCN 14115), suggests a low metallicity. We
also report a tentative evidence for an intervening MgII absorber at
z=1.658

time of 750 and 720 s, respectively. Consistent with the latest XRT 
position (Osborne et al. GCN 12857; see also

This position is consistent with that of the tentative near-infrared

A spectrum of this source was taken on 2013 Feb 13 with the ESO VLT 
equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph, covering the wavelength range 
3000-20500 AA. The seeing was 0.6"". In the NIR arm, we detect several

hints for [O III] (4959) and [O II] (3727) at a common redshift z =

host spectra is readily explained by their location in non-favorable 
parts of the spectrum. In the UVB arm, the host continuum is detected 
down to ~4750 AA, which corresponds to the onset of the Lyman alpha

At z = 2.94 the host is a fairly luminous galaxy at 2000  rest-frame, 
roughly 0.5 mag brighter than L* at that redshift (e.g. Gabasch et al.

The total exposure was 3x1200s using a low resolution grating (R~600)

observations had to be carried out at high airmass, between 1.6 and 2.2. 
There were thin cirrus but seeing was very good, at 0.6"".

At this epoch, the spectrum presents undulations typical of SN spectra, 
including a prominent bump at ~8200 A. Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007,

The spectrum gives a good match to a number of SNe Ic, including 
broad-lined and normal events such as SN 2002ap and SN 1994I, around 
maximum light or slightly after. By leaving the redshift unconstrained we

Our late observations were performed on 2010-11-10, 105 days
after the trigger, and consisted of dithered images with a total of
4427 s exposure in g'r'i'z' and 3600 s in JHK under clear sky

Inside the enhanced X-ray error-circle

with uncertainties of 0.3"" in each coordinate.
Registering the early afterglow images (Olivares et al., GCN 11020)
against the late host frame, we derive an offset between galaxy
center and afterglow of approximately 0.4"".

A spectrum of this galaxy was taken on 2012-11-15 with the ESO VLT

A spectrum of the GRB 130427A afterglow was obtained with the
Large Binocular Telescope (LBT+MODS1 instrument) on 2013 May 7.15 (UT),
9.8 days after the burst. The spectrum covers 340 nm to 950 nm and
is dominated by a power-law continuum. Narrow Balmer, [OII], [OIII]
emission lines, and MgII and MgI absorption lines from the host
galaxy are present at a redshift of 0.340.

The LBT spectrum shows no obvious undulations characteristic of a
broad-lined type Ic supernova such as SN 1998bw. In contrast,
a 98bw-like supernova was detectable from GRB 030329 around
seven days after its burst (Stanek et al. 2003, ApJ, 591, L17).
This early detection was primarily due to the prominent peak
seen around 500 nm (rest frame) in broad-lined type Ic events.

Adding a pre-maximum spectrum of SN 1998bw
(Patat et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 900) to a power-law continuum
suggests that any 98bw-like supernova is at least an R-band
magnitude fainter than the afterglow 10 days after the

We observed the position of GRB 130427A with the 4.2m William Herschel telescope,
using the PFIP camera, on May 8th, under good seeing conditions (0.7 arcseconds). 
Exposures of 4x600 seconds were obtained using a narrowband filter covering 
the [O II] emission line doublet (3728 A) at the redshift of the 
GRB (z=0.3399; Levan et al., Xu et al. and Flores et al.; GCN 14455, 14478, 14491).
We used this filter to obtain the best visibility of the host galaxy against the bright afterglow
and possible supernova contribution.
The resulting data show a clear detection of the host galaxy. The GRB is located near, but
somewhat offset from, a brighter patch in the host. The host is an irregular galaxy, with
a broadly elliptical shape. The GRB is located North-West of the
majority of extended, smooth, host emission - a convenient choice in spectrograph slit
position angle may minimize host contamination and aid in identification of SN signatures.
The long axis of the host is approximately oriented along 70 degrees position angle (where
North=0, East = 90 degrees), and is approximately 3.4 arcseconds in length.

(Racusin et al. GCN 15944) with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT)

Despite the low SNR and a seeing of ~2, we detect broad absorption

were delayed due to bad weather and had a mean epoch of 6:12 UT (3.59

not optimal, as the airmass at that time was ~1.8 and most of the observation
was performed during twilight.

The spectrum shows a low S/N continuum, which is however, visible
between 5100 and 9500 A. Some absorption features seem to be present,
and in particular we identify a broad feature at 5300 A, with an observed
equivalent width of ~30 A. This could correspond to a weak Ly-alpha
(log(N_H/cm^-2) ~< 20) absorption at z=3.35. However, no other features
corresponding to that same redshift are seen, which is not unexpected for
a low density line of sight that would correspond to such a Ly-alpha feature
and a low S/N spectrum. Further absorptions could correspond to intervening
MgII absorbers.

In the acquisition image, we detect a point source, which is not
detected in the SDSS, at the position (J2000):

that of the NIR afterglow reported by Covino et al. (GCN 17039).  We
measure a (preliminary) magnitude of R=19.2+-0.1 (Vega).

We detect a variety of absorption features throughout the entire
spectrum. In particular, a wide trough is visible centered around 4800
AA, which we interpret as due to H I absorption at redshift z~3.
Identification of several metal features as due to, among others, Si
II, C II, Fe II, C IV, SiIV, allows us to refine the value to
z=2.993. The presence of several fine structure lines of Fe II, Si II,

On June 15, 18:59:01.20 UTC, Fermi/GBM triggered (G. Younes et al., GCN 17932)
on a hard X-ray flare from V404 Cyg.  For the next 12 days, GBM triggered
169 times on flares from this source.  Many of the triggers arose, not
from individual events but from Earth occultation edges of longer events.
The last GBM trigger for V404 Cyg occurred on June 27, 23:27:50.54 UTC and
we assume that the source has fallen below GBMs threshold on its return
to quiescence.  

Quarter day integrated Earth occultation (PI C. A. Wilson-Hodge) results
show that V404 Cyg reached a maximum flux in the 25-50 keV band of 7.2 crab
on June 26 while the source reached a maximum flux in the 100-300 keV band
of 5.2 crab on June 19.

A list of V404 Cyg triggers can be found in the trigger catalog by searching
for the 'TRANSNT' trigger type and confirming the location.

Swift BAT triggered on the early activity of GRB 151027A (Maselli et
al. 2015, GCN 18478). Swift XRT started observing 87 s after the
trigger observing the main event. By using the Swift/XRT spectrum
repository at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/ (see Evans et al.
2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177) we selected a time interval with an almost
constant hardness ratio, starting at 150 s after the burst onset
and lasting 281 s. We then fit the Window Timing (WT) spectrum with
XSPEC using the model tbabs*ztbabs*pow.
We assume a Galactic column density of 3.75x10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et
al. 2013, MNRAS, 431, 394) and we allow for a 30% uncertainty in the fit.
We fit the spectrum using C-statistics (C-stat=593.74 with 637 d.o.f.).
In the intrinsic column density vs. redshift plane there is just one 
deep minimum
hinting for a redshift z=0.38+/-0.17 (90% confidence level) and an
intrinsic column density N_H(z)=(3.6+/-0.7)x10^21 cm^-2.
The X-ray spectrum is soft with Gamma=2.6, (assuming a cut-off power
law spectrum the allowed redshift range expands to 0.27-1.38).

We observed the field of GRB 151031A (Sonbas et al., GCN 18538) with the 
ESO Very Large Telescope UT2 (Kueyen) equipped with the X-shooter 
spectrograph. Observations were carried out using the automatic ""rapid 
response mode"" (RRM), and started immediately following the reception of 
the XRT position notice.

In the acquisition images, we detect a single source consistent with the 
position of the XRT afterglow, at coordinates (J2000):

RA = 05:32:47.11
Dec = -39:07:19.1

We measure for this object R = 20.4 +- 0.1 (calibrated against three 
nearby USNO stars) in an image taken on Oct 31.2565 UT, that is 18.8 min 
after the GRB.

A sequence of spectra with increasing exposure time (3 to 32 min) was 
secured covering the wavelength range 3,000 - 25,000 AA. From the 
analysis of the first 8 min data, several absorption features can be 
seen on top of the object continuum, which we interpret as due to Ca II, 
Mg I, Mg II and Fe II in absorption at a common redshift of z = 1.167. 
In the visible arm, an emission feature is also seen, corresponding to 
[O ii] at a consistent redshift, which we thus consider to be the 
redshift of GRB 151031A. Analysis of the full data set is ongoing.

Observations started at 05:31:33 UT on November 13, about 1.9 days after the GRB trigger.
The initially reported source at the coordinates of RA, Dec = 56.84483, -44.16201 (+/- 0.2) (Graham et al. GCN 18585)
has clearly faded (e.g. in the r band from 22.19 +/- 0.04 to 22.68 +/- 0.05 mag) and we thus conclude that this source is the optical afterglow of GRB 151111A.

In the acquisition image, we identify the afterglow proposed by Golkhou

coordinates of (J2000.0, +/-0.5""):

R.A.: 09:46:48.56

magnitude of i(AB) = 23.76+/-0.11, and the second one is at 09:46:48.55,

afterglow above 7300 AA, below which the emission drops abruptly. The 
other object shows a continuum over the complete spectral range, 
suggesting that this object is unrelated to the GRB. The afterglow 
spectrum is indicative of a Lyman-alpha drop at a redshift between 4.90

and is likely the host galaxy of GRB 160425A.

The spectrum reveals two distinct systems at z=0.555, based 
on emission lines of Halpha, Hbeta, [O III], [O II] and [S III].  
The velocity separation between them is ~180 km/s, and the 
spatial separation is consistent with the two knots seen in
the imaging (corresponding to ~8 kpc at this distance), 
suggesting an interacting pair of galaxies.

report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

On June 24, 12:12:58 UT (~T+46min after the burst) we observed
the field of the Swift short GRB160624A (DAi  et al. GCN 19560, 
Evans et al. GCN 19562) with the GMOS-N camera mounted on the
Gemini North telescope.

In a 180s r-band acquisition image a galaxy is identified 
within the enhanced XRT error circle. The galaxy is also visible 
in SDSS. We performed a 900s spectroscopic observation with the 
R400 grating covering the 3800-8100 Angstrom wavelength range.

The galaxy spectrum reveals emission features of [OIII]5007, 
H-beta and [OII]3727 at the common redshift of z=0.483.

We also obtained deeper r band imaging with the GMOS camera: no
other source is detected in the enhanced error circle down to 
a limiting magnitude of r~25.5, although we are not sensitive to
possible faint point source superposed on the galaxy light.

We thank the Gemini staff for their extremely rapid
response, in particular Andrew Stephens.",0.483,z=0.483,160624A,GRB160624A,Gemini-North,Gemini North telescope,Spectroscopic,Spectroscopic,2016-06-24 13:38:07.000

Cano et al. GCN 22345) with OSIRIS at the 10.4m GTC telescope. The 
observation consisted of 3x900s exposure with grism R1000B, covering 
the range between 3700 and 7800 Angstrom and was performed under 
bad seeing conditions.

The observation started at 20:32 UT (16.28 hr after the burst), and the 
acquisition image shows the afterglow at r=21.2+/-0.2. The spectrum 
shows a weak continuum over all the spectral range. The low signal to 
noise ratio of the spectrum only allows us to detect a single broad spectral 
feature that we identify as Lyman alpha at a redshift of 2.487.",2.487,2.487,180115A,GRB 180115A,GTC,10.4m GTC telescope,No Information,Spectroscopic,2018-01-15 22:57:40.000

Preliminary analysis of the spectrum reveals continuum flux down to 3600 
AA, which sets an upper limit to the redshift z <~ 2 via the lack of any 
obvious DLA feature. In addition, we identify several absorption lines 
at a common redshift of z=1.305, the most prominent being ZnII/CrII, 
FeII, MgII, and MgI. Moreover, we also identify another absorption 
system at z=0.63 based on the detection of the MgII doublet. Therefore, 
we propose the most probable redshift of the GRB to be z=1.305, with an 
intervening system at 0.638.

We observed the field of GRB 180624A (Swift trigger 844192; Gibson et 
al., GCN 22832) with the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) 
instrument mounted on the 2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt Graham, AZ, USA). 
Images were obtained starting at 10:15 UT on 2018-06-25, 20.5 hr after 
the  GRB trigger.

Inspection of the 60 s acquisition image reveals a point source within 
the Swift/XRT enhanced error circle (Evans et al., GCN 22835), at 
coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 21:12:23.378
Dec(J2000)= -02:20:17.30

with an uncertainty of 0.2"" in each coordinate, which is consistent with 
the source reported by Guidorzi et al. (GCN 22839). The source has 
magnitude r' = 20.6 +- 0.1 (AB), calibrated against r'-band SDSS field 
stars, and it is not visible in Pan-STARRS images, thus clearly singling 
it out as the afterglow.

Spectroscopy of the source was obtained for a total of 2x600 s, covering 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA. A broad trough is well visible 
centered around 4700 AA, which we identify as a DLA feature at z ~ 2.86. 
Detection of several absorption features, which we interpret as due to, 
among others, Si II, C IV, Al II, Al III, Fe II, allows to precisely 
measure the redshift to be z = 2.855, which we consider to be the 
redshift of GRB 180624A.

We also note the presence of a close-by and fainter galaxy, which is 
also visible in the Pan-STARRS images, 2.5"" NW of the afterglow, at 
position:
RA(J2000) = 21:12:23.244
Dec(J2000)= -02:20:15.76
possibly consistent with the extended source reported by Schady (GCN

related to the GRB, as it would have an unreasonable brightness and 
large separation at z = 2.8.

No correction for the expected Galactic foreground extinction, 
corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.05 mag in the direction of

wavelength range from 3000-25000 AA.

A red continuum is detected across the spectral range. We detect
absorption features due to Mg II (3124,3132), Mg I (3187), and Ca II
(4395,4434) at a consistent redshift of z=0.117, which we propose as the
redshift of the GRB.  Galactic ISM absorption features of Ca II and Na I
are also detected.

This GRB resembles the famous GRB 030329, but slightly less energetic
(E_iso = 2e+51 erg given the fluence value provided by Veres et al., GCN
23053).  It is the closest energetic (E_iso > 1e+51 erg) GRB with a
measured redshift to date.

We note that although Galactic extinction in this direction is
significant (A_V = 0.763; Schlafly et al. 2011, ApJ 737:103) a campaign
to study the anticipated associated supernova should still be practical
with moderate-aperture telescopes at this redshift.

4x600 s exposure time.

In a 5-s image taken with the acquisition camera on 2018 Oct 10.023 UT, 
we measure for the afterglow R ~ 17.3 (Vega), assuming R = 18.34 for the 
USNO star at RA = 00:55:51.53, Dec = -47:23:14.5.

The spectrum has a very high S/N. A wide trough is easily visible around 
4780 AA, which we interpret as a DLA in the GRB host system. From 
detection of a plethora of absorption lines, including Al II, Al III, S 
II, O I, Si II, Si IV, C IV, Zn II, Cr II, Ni II, Fe II, Mn II, O I*, Si 
II*, Ni II*, Fe II*, we measure the redshift to be z = 2.938. The 
velocity structure of the lines spans the redshift range 2.9360-2.9407 
(2.938 corresponding to the strongest component). The detection of 
fine-structure lines makes the redshift association with the GRB host 
system secure. Intervening absorbers are also detected at z = 1.788 (Mg 
II), 2.172 (Mg II), and 2.822 (C IV).

days after the GRB detection. The slit was centred on the nucleus of the 
nearby object visible in the Pan-STARRS archival images, and was 
oriented in order to include the afterglow position.

While only weak continuum is visible, several clear emission lines are 
detected in the near-infrared arm. We identify the [O ii] 3727/3729 
doublet, Hbeta, [O iii] 4959, and [O iii] 5007, at a common redshift z = 
2.469.

No clear emission (lines nor continuum) is detected at the location of 
the afterglow, so we have no direct measurement of the GRB redshift. The 
random association probability with the Pan-STARRS object is however 
rather small (~3*10^-3), suggesting a physical connection. We also note 
that the Pan-STARRS galaxy is exceptionally luminous, with an absolute 
magnitude M = -22.9 AB (computed at 1800 AA rest frame). The measured 
offset would correspond to 6.6 kpc in projection - a rather large value

We clearly detect continuum over the full covered wavelength range. A strong absorption is visible around 5474 AA, and an emission feature at 5479 AA, which we identify as due to H I. This is confirmed by the presence of the Ly alpha forest blueward of this wavelength. We also detect other narrower absorption features which we interpret as due to e.g. C IV and Si IV at a common redshift z = 3.503.

Using INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS realtime data (following [1]) we have performed
a search for a prompt gamma-ray counterpart of S191213g.

At the time of the event (2019-12-13 04:34:08 UTC, hereafter T0),
INTEGRAL was operating in nominal mode. The peak of the event
localization probability was at an angle of 99 deg with respect to the
spacecraft pointing axis. This orientation implies strongly suppressed
(7.4% of optimal) response of ISGRI, strongly suppressed (34% of
optimal) response of IBIS/Veto, and somewhat suppressed (40% of
optimal) response of SPI-ACS.

The background within +/-300 seconds around the event was very stable
(excess variance 1.1).

We have performed a search for any impulsive events in INTEGRAL SPI-
ACS (as described in [2]) data.

We do not detect any significant counterparts and estimate a 3-sigma
upper limit on the 75-2000 keV fluence of 5.2e-07 erg/cm^2 (within the
50% probability containment region of the source localization) for a
burst lasting less than 1 s with a characteristic short GRB spectrum
(an exponentially cut off power law with alpha=-0.5 and Ep=600 keV)
occurring at any time in the interval within 300 s around T0. For a
typical long GRB spectrum (Band function with alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and
Ep=300 keV), the derived peak flux upper limit is ~5.2e-07 (8e-08)
erg/cm^2/s at 1 s (8 s) time scale in 75-2000 keV energy range.

For the mean reported distance 195.0 Mpc this corresponds to the limit
on the total isotropic equivalent energy in 1 s of 2.4e+48 erg for
the short GRB spectrum and for a long GRB spectrum isotropic
equivalent luminosity in 1 s (8 s) of 1.1e+48 erg/s (3.6e+47 erg/s)

We report for completeness and in order of FAP, all excesses
identified in the search region. We find: 4 likely background
excesses:

scale | T | S/N | luminosity ( x 1e+48 erg/s) | FAP  
3.75 | 67 | 3.8 | 14.6 +/- 5.37 +/- 11.6 | 0.076 
5 | -222 | 4.6 | 15 +/- 4.65 +/- 11.9 | 0.084 
4.3 | 89.8 | 3.5 | 12.3 +/- 5.01 +/- 9.76 | 0.159 
1.1 | 15.2 | 3.1 | 23.3 +/- 9.93 +/- 18.5 | 0.226 

Note that FAP estimates (especially at timescales above 2s) may be
possibly further affected by enhanced non-stationary local background
noise. This list excludes any excesses for which FAP is close to
unity.

We obtained spectroscopic observations of the optical counterpart (Izzo 
et al., GCN #29066, Jelinek et al., GCN #29070) of the MAGIC-detected 
(Blanch et al., GCN #29075) GRB 201216C (Beardmore et al., GCN #29061, 
Malacaria et al., GCN #29073, Nadella et al., GCN #29074) with the ESO 
Very Large Telescope UT 3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter 
spectrograph, covering the wavelength range 3200-22000 AA. Observations 
started at 01:30 UT on 2020-12-17, 2.38 hr after the burst, and 
consisted of 4 exposures of 600 s each.

The afterglow is well-detected in the stacked spectrum, but the 
continuum is very red. As a consequence, the S/N drops dramatically from 
the red to the blue end. We identify a doublet which we tentatively 
match to Ca II H & K at z = 1.10. Unfortunately, no other lines are 
detected to confirm this value, though most of them would fall in a 
spectral region of poor S/N. We note that Ca II H&K absorption is 
uncommon in intervening absorbers, making it likely this is the actual 
redshift of the GRB, and that it does not lie at an even greater 
distance (in accordance with the VHE detection).

A redshift of z = 1.1 would place this object among the most distant 
known VHE sources. Using the Fermi GBM parameters (Malacaria et al., GCN 
#29073), we derive a an observer-frame 10-1000 keV isotropic energy 
release of E_iso = (4.71 +/- 0.16) * 10^53 erg.

Based on our grz photometry (Izzo et al., GCN 29066), we measure a 
spectral slope beta_opt = 4.1 +- 0.2 (Fnu propto nu^-beta), which is an 
unusually red value, suggesting significant extinction. This is 
confirmed by the optical-to-X-ray spectral index, beta_OX ~ 0.1 which 
indicates a very low optical/X-ray flux ratio, making this a bona fide 
dark GRB.

We observed the field of GRB 201221A (Page et al., GCN 29096) using the 
ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph.

Using the acquisition camera, multi-band imaging was secured. Within the 
XRT error circle (Evans, GCN 29097), no source is detected in an r-band 
image (taken at mean epoch of 42 min after the GRB) down to limiting 
magnitude r > 23.5 (AB). However, a source is clearly visible in the 
z-band image with z = 19.76 +- 0.04 AB (mean time 35 min after the GRB). 
The corresponding color r-z > 3.7 is exceptionally red. The coordinates 
of the object are (J2000, 0.3"" error):

RA = 14:17:55.26
Dec = -45:24:58.0

Spectroscopy of the z-band source was executed covering the wavelength 
range 3000-25000 AA. Unfortunately due to visibility constraints, only 
two spectra by 600 s each were secured, plus two extra exposures during 
twilight which have lower quality. We report on the analysis of the 
first set only, which has a mean time of 1.65 hr after the GRB.

Continuum is well detected in the infrared arm, as well as in the red 
part of the visible arm. A clear break is detected around 8150 AA, 
which, if interpreted as the Lyman break, corresponds to z = 5.70. Weak 
continuum is detected blueward of the break, until it vanishes 
completely at the corresponding location of the Lyman limit. We thus 
conclude that z = 5.70 is the redshift of GRB 201221A.

Further analysis is undergoing.

in the Legacy Survey, with AB magnitude r ~ 23.7. We conclude that the 
above source is the optical afterglow of GRB 210517A, and the archival 
object is its host galaxy.

In our spectra, continuum is detected over the whole observed range. A 
prominent emission line is detected around 4236 AA, which we identify as

Observation consisted of 3 x 900 s exposures with grism R1000B, covering the range between 3700 and 7800 AA. The first spectrum started at 01:36:20 UT (5.75 hr after the burst).

The spectrum shows a very strong continuum with very weak superposed lines. We detect lines corresponding to FeII, MgII and MgI at a common redshift of z = 1.1345, in agreement with the measurement from the NOT (Fynbo et al. GCN 30182). Additionally, the high SNR allows us to detect a weak intervening system through the identification of MgII at a redshift of z = 0.557. Although the redshift 1.1345 is, strictly speaking, a lower limit, the lack of any further features at higher redshift, especially considering the high SNR of the spectrum, allows us to consider this as the redshift of the GRB.

We note that the features detected at the redshift of the GRB are very weak. We can compare their strength to a sample of long GRB afterglow features using the line strength parameter, following the method of de Ugarte Postigo et al. (2012, A&A 548, A11). For this spectrum we measure LSP = -2.1 +/- 0.8, which implies that the lines are weaker than 99.8% of the sample.",1.1345,1.1345,210610B,GRB 210610B,GTC,GTC (10.4m),No Information,Spectroscopic,2021-06-11 08:38:27.000

the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) instrument mounted on the 
2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt Graham, AZ, USA). Data were obtained at the 
mid time of 12:40 UT on 2021-11-06, ~13.6 days after the burst trigger.

At the position of the UVOT localization (Kuin & Dichiara, GCN 30975) 
and the Legacy Survey object (Pozanenko et al., GCN 30972), we detect 
the GRB host galaxy (Sakamato et al. GCN 31038, Rastinejad et al. GCN

g = 24.02+-0.17
r = 23.99+-0.15
calibrated against Pan-STARRS field stars and not corrected for Galactic 
extinction.

Spectroscopy of the source was obtained for a total of 4550s, covering 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA.Continuum is faintly detected over 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA, and a single emission line is 
visible at ~6940 AA. The most likely interpretation is [O II] at z = 
0.862. At this redshift, [O III] would unfortunately fall on top of a 
region affected by sky lines, so its non-detection is not very 
constraining. Other interpretations are less likely. We can disregard 
Lyalpha, since there is no drop in the continuum blueward of the line. 
We deem Halpha unlikely, as the corresponding redshift z = 0.057 would 
imply an extremely faint host galaxy (absolute magnitude ~ -13), and we 
don't see the expected [O III] and Hbeta lines. The interpretation of 
the observed feature as [O III] 5008 seems to be also unlikely as we 
would expect to detect hints of [O III] 4959 as well as Halpha which 
would fall in a wavelength region clean of skylines.

Assuming the redshift z=0.862, standard cosmology (Planck 2016) and 
Swift/BAT refined and on-line automated spectral analysis (Laha et al., 
GCN 30979, and http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1080859/BA/ 
<http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1080859/BA/>) we estimate an 
isotropic-equivalent radiated energy Eiso (1-10000 keV) of about 
(0.9-1.2)x E^51 erg, which is typical of short GRBs. However, we note that:
a) despite its short duration, the burst has a rather soft spectrum 
(simple power with index ~2) which is consistent with a spectral peak 
energy Ep close to (or even below) the BAT low-energy threshold and 
would imply a rest-frame peak energy Ep,i < ~30-40 keV, thus locating 
this GRB in the region of the Ep,i - Eiso plane populated by long GRBs. 
The preliminary automatic modelling with a cut-off power-law or a Band 
function is consistent with a larger Ep,i, which would make this burst 
more similar to other short GRBs, but with a very large uncertainty.
b) the soft spectra and short duration put GRB 211023B closer to the 
region populated by long GRBs than to to the one populated by short 
events also in the HR-T90 diagram, even though it is still consistent 
with belonging to the tail of the distribution of short GRBs in this plane.

The spectrum is in low resolution and rather low S/N. However, a broad 
absorption feature is evident centering at ~ 6820 AA, which can 
interpreted as Ly_alpha absorption. Besides Ly_alpha, other weak lines 
such as Si II, C II, Si IV are also detected at the common redshift of z 
= 4.61. We thus conclude that z = 4.61 is likely the redshift of the GRB.

first observations were carried out using the acquisition camera, using 
the g, r and z filters (3x60 s in each band). Inside the XRT error 
circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 31472), we detect a new source, not 
visible in the archival Pan-STARRS images, which we identify as the GRB 
afterglow. The source is very red, being detected strongly in z, only 
weakly in r, and completely missing in g. Calibrated against nearby 
stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog, we measure z = 20.81 +- 0.12 mag and 
z - r ~ 2.1 mag (all AB magnitudes). The afterglow coordinates are 
(J2000, 0.2"" error):

RA = 06:06:17.409
Dec = -28:26:15.78

A spectrum was secured covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA, and 
consisting of 4 exposures of 1200 s each. The observation mid time was 
2022 Jan 18.15 UT (11.3 hr after the GRB).

In a preliminary reduction, continuum is detected in the red part of the 
spectrum down to ~7260 AA. We interpret the break as due to Lyman alpha. 
The absorption system is rather weak and, at the present time, we 
identify with confidence only the Lyman-alpha trough and the Si II 1260

increases the efficiency of the J and H bands, resulting in a wavelength 
coverage between 3000 to 21000 AA. 

In a preliminary reduction we detect two weak emission lines that we

[OII]4960 at a common redshift of z=1.1137+/-0.0002. The other line of 
the OII doublet, [OII]3729 is affected by a sky line and is consequently 
not detected. H-alpha falls within a telluric absorption and H-beta in a 
spectral region of low sensitivity, both resulting in non detections. Given 
the spatial coincidence of these emissions with the afterglow, we identify 
the underlying object as the host galaxy and propose this as the redshift 
of the GRB.

On May 22.16 UT (T0+4.5 hr after the GRB) we observed the afterglow, of GRB 220521A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 32075; Dichiara et al., GCN 32076; Poolakkil & Meegan, GCN 32089; Strausbaugh et al., GCN 32091) with the Gemini-South telescope and the GMOS camera.

We performed a series of spectroscopic observations with the R400 grating centered at 7500 AA (2x600 s) and 8100 AA (2x600 s). Observations were obtained at an average airmass of 2.34.  In our 300 s, z-band acquisition image we detected the GRB counterpart at the NOT optical afterglow location (Malesani et al., GCN 32078).

In our preliminary analysis we measured z (AB)=20.9 +/- 0.3, calibrated against 10 PS1 stars. No extinction correction has been applied.

Our visual inspection of the spectroscopic data confirms the redshift reported by Fynbo et al. (GCN 32079) as z=5.57 based on the detection of Lyman alpha, SiIV and Ni lines.

the faint object visible in the archival optical images from the Legacy Survey,
coincident with the optical and X-ray afterglow, first noticed by
Rastinejad et al. (GCN 32208).

The observation was performed on 2022 September 23 (104 days after the GRB)
and consisted of 4x1200 s in the UVB and VIS arms and 8x600 s in the NIR arm.
A filter was adopted to block part of the K band which in return increases
the efficiency of the J and H bands, resulting in a wavelength coverage
between 3000 to 21000 AA.

In a preliminary reduction, we detect several strong emission lines that
we identify as Lyman-alpha, [O II] 3729, [O III] 4959 and [O III] 5007 at a
common redshift of z = 2.3608 +/- 0.0002. The [O II] 3726 and H-beta lines
are affected by sky lines and are consequently not clearly detected. H-alpha
falls outside the covered wavelength range.

This result is supported by a VLT/MUSE spectrum obtained on 2022 August 24,
covering the wavelength range 4800 to 9300 AA, which shows no emission nor
absorption features, consistent with the measured redshift from X-shooter.

The positional coincidence between our target and the optical and X-ray
afterglow suggests a physical association. Furthermore, our spectra show
that the archival counterpart is a star-forming galaxy, akin to a typical
long GRB host. Our observations bring thus evidence that the GRB was not
physically associated with the local, nearby galaxy MCG-06-10-007 at z = 0.049
(Cenko et al., GCN 32191), and their proximity is a chance coincidence.

 From the acquisition image, we measure for the optical counterpart a 
magnitude i = 19.89 +- 0.05 (AB; calibrated against Pan-STARRS), 4.45 
days after the Fermi/GBM trigger.

The continuum is still dominated by the afterglow. However, narrow 
emission lines can be seen from the host galaxy. We identify H alpha in 
the optical and Pa alpha in the near-infrared, at redshift z = 0.151, 
consistent with the one measured from the afterglow absorption features 
(de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 32648).

The H alpha FWHM is about 110 km s^-1. From the H alpha flux, corrected 
for Galactic extinction (A_V = 4.2 mag), we infer a SFR > 0.25 M_Sun

The spectrum shows a trace throughout the whole range, with a broad absorption feature at ~ 4150 AA, which can be interpreted as Lya at z~2.4. Redward several prominent absorption features are present, which can be interpreted as due to Si II, O I, C II, Si IV, C IV, Ni II, Fe II at a common redshift of z = 2.42, being consistent with the Lya feature.

At the time of the observations the afterglow magnitude was R~17.7 and
the decay of the afterglow, as measured from the FORS1 flux-calibrated

We compared the available photometry with a power law afterglow,

presents two minima. The lowest chi square corresponds to the solution 
with z~6.6 and little rest-frame extinction as reported in GCN 4545. The 
other minimum corresponds to a solution with z=3.8-4.5 (1 sigma

we  obtained low resolution spectra of the afterglow of GRB 060116

consisted of 10 exposures of 1800 seconds each using the grism 300I with 
a 1"" slit under good seeing conditions.  A very faint object, close to 
the detection limit, is visible at the afterglow position in the

The latter line is located on the edge of the atmospheric A-band and and
its reality is therefore questionable.  We find three possible
interpretations for the redshift:

[1] The broad line is the (barely resolved) [OII] 3727 doublet at z=1.099.  
In this case there is no obvious interpretation for the second line.

[2] The broad line is H-alpha and the weak line line is [OI] 6364 at

doublets, which we do not.

[3] The broad line is [OIII] 5007 and the weak line is H-beta at z=0.562.  
In this case we expect to detect [OIII] 4959, which we do not.

Given that the weak line may not be real, and the lack of detection of
various other lines expected in scenarios [2] and [3], we favor the first
interpretation and a redshift z=1.099.

On 31 May 2006 UT, using Keck I (+LRIS), we obtained spectra of a  
bright red extended source (""G*""; RA, DEC J2000 = 18:35:45.7,  
+52:37:37) that is 11.2 arcsec South of the southern edge of the  
revised XRT error circle (Troja et al. GCN 5093). Strong absorption  
features, which we identify as Ca II H+K, indicate a redshift for  
this early type galaxy of z=0.287. Weak [OII] emission can be seen  
indicating some low level of active star formation.

We advance the hypothesis that this galaxy is the host of short burst  
GRB 060502B (Troja et al. GCN 5055) based on several points:

      1. The galaxy is a massive early-type similar to the putative  
hosts of 050509B [1] and 050724 [2].

      2. The redshift inferred of the hosts of 050509b (z=0.225) and  
050724 (z=0.258) are remarkably similar to that of G* indicating  
comparable energetics of the respective bursts.

      3. At the redshift of z=0.287, the burst location would be  
between 47 - 67 kpc in projection from the center of the putative  
host, similar to the offset (39 +/- 13 kpc) inferred for 050509b.  
There are viable progenitors scenarios (e.g. degenerate binary  
mergers) where bursts occur at such distances from their birthsite.

      4. Weak X-ray afterglow and no detected optical afterglow would  
seem to indicate a low density circumburst environment, as would be  
expected if the GRB originated far from the progenitor birthsite.

We recognize the difficulty of now confirming this hypothesis but  
note that in the striking similarity of the host, redshift,  
afterglow, and offset configuration to GRB 050509b, these  
observations and inferences have a priori precedent.""

19.3 UTC.  In each image we identify a single emission line at 7388A
superposed on a continuum emission with no apparent absorption

However, there is a hint of a line at 5634A which suggests that the line
is actually due to Halpha at z = 0.13.

In addition to the bright emission line due to the GRB host galaxy,
there is a brighter emission line at the same wavelength from the galaxy
17 arcsec North of the GRB.  A spectrum from the Magellan telescope
reveals the presence of the [N II] doublet flanking the Halpha line for
this galaxy, with a secure redshift of z = 0.125.  Based on the
identical wavelength of the lines, the two galaxies are likely related,

5387,"GRB 051109B:  Bright spiral host galaxy at low redshiftD. A. Perley, R. J. Foley, J. S. Bloom and N. R. Butler (UCB) report:

On the night of 2006 July 25 (UT), we imaged the field of GRB051109B 
(GCN 4222) for 630 seconds in g' and 600 seconds in R using Keck I (+ 
LRIS).  There is a bright (R ~ 14.5) spiral galaxy close to the XRT 
position (GCN 4226), also visible in DSS and other surveys.  In our 
imaging, the galaxy is observed to be a barred spiral of type SBa.  The 
presence of a faint tidal bridge indicates that the galaxy has recently 
interacted with a neighboring galaxy 60"" to the north.

Using 25 X-ray sources and 51 DSS sources in the field, we calculate an 
improved XRT position of RA = 23:01:50.21, dec = +38:40:46.0 (with a 90% 
uncertainty radius of 2.2"", including an estimate of the systematic 
error.)  This position lies inside an outer spiral arm of the galaxy, 
identifying it as the GRB host.  In addition, both our position and the 
original XRT error circle include a faint optical point-like source at 
RA = 23:01:50.30, dec = +38:40:46.7 (0.5"" uncertainty).

We obtained spectroscopy of the host galaxy and optical source the 
following night.  The galaxy is observed to be at a redshift of z = 
0.080, and lacks any strong emission features.  Spectroscopy of the 
point source inside the XRT error circle shows no evidence for a 
nebular-phase supernova; however, there are emission lines indicating 
active star formation in this region.

The offset of the position of the optical source to the galaxy center is 
14.1"", or 20.9 kpc at the observed redshift.  This is the largest offset 
yet seen in a long GRB in angular or physical scale.  Using the 15-150 
keV gamma-ray fluence (GCN 4237), E_iso for this GRB is 4.1 x 10^48 
ergs, comparable to that observed for GRB980425 but less than that of 
any other GRB.  GRB980425/SN1998bw was also seen in a spiral galaxy at 
large offset, and also lacked a detected optical afterglow.

Given the low redshift of this system, inspection of archival images for 
the presence or absence of supernova emission is strongly encouraged. 
We also encourage radio and X-ray observations to look for a late-time 
afterglow or supernova.

found a new strong SiIV absorption system with Ly-alpha, at redshift 
z=3.78. This redshift is higher than the previous claimed redshift of 
the GRB, z=3.711 (Ferrero et al. 2006, GCN 5489), which also show 
SiIV absorption. These two SiIV absorptions are separated by about 
4000 km/s, and are similar to the double CIV absorption detected in 
the afterglow of GRB 021004 (separation 2400 km/s; Savaglio et al. 
2002, GCN 1633; Fiore et al. 2005, 624, 853) and GRB 030226 
(separation 2400 km/s; Klose et al. 2004, AJ 128, 1942).
A redshift z=3.8 for GRB 060605 was previously suggested by Peterson 
et al. (GCN 5223).

with the
300V grism covering a wavelength range of 3500-9500A.

The spectrum consists of a largely featureless continuum from about  
4000-9400A
with the exception of an apparent emission line at ~9310A. The  
emission-line
is very close to the prominent telluric skyline at 9313A, but is seen  
in each
of the three individual spectra. The lack of other detected lines in the
observed wavelength range suggests that the emission line is due to  
[O II] at
a red-shift of z=1.497. It should be cautioned, however, that this  
host galaxy
appears to be highly reddened (as already noted by Rol et al., GCN

Using FORS1 on the Very Large Telescope, we have obtained 3*30 min

UVOT optical afterglow candidate (Marshall & Grupe, GCN 6392) has 
clearly faded in our acquisition image. Using photometric zeropoints 
from the ESO webpages we estimate the afterglow magnitude to be
R ~ 22.0 on May 8.337 (3.79 hours post-burst).

The combined spectrum does not display any obvious absorption 
features. However, a firm upper limit of z < 2.3 can be placed on 
the redshift of GRB 070508 from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in 
the spectrum of the afterglow. This is consistent with the UVOT 
observations (Marshall & Grupe, GCN 6392).

We do detect a tentative emission line at 6781 A. If it corresponds 
to H-alpha at z = 0.033, we would expect to detect H-beta and the 
[O III] doublet in our spectrum. However, no features are visible 
at their predicted locations. The most probable association is with 
[O II] 3728, corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.82. We caution
that the magnitude reported above is then most likely affected by

2: RA = 02:12:33.03, Dec = -02:11:41.6

We acquired spectra for both objects. Thanks to the detection of a DLA

The spectrum is typical of a GRB afterglow, and we thus suggest that

The Swift BAT discovery data show the burst to have had a short, hard 
main component of three seconds duration followed by a soft, longer 
duration tail (Sakamoto et al. GCN 6623).  The main component also shows 
a small spectral lag (Norris et al. GCN 6631).  Both of these 
observations are consistent with GRB 070714B being a short GRB.  This 
then would be the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift of a 
short burst.

The observed fluence of 7.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm^2 (Barbier et al. GCN 6638) 
at a redshift of z=.92 corresponds to an isotropic energy release of 
Eiso = 1.6 x 10^51 erg.",0.92,z=.92,070714B,GRB 070714B,Gemini,Gemini Observatory,Spectroscopic,Spectroscopic,2007-10-02 00:36:25.000

M. W. Auger (UC Davis) report on behalf of GRAASP:

We obtained spectroscopic follow-up of the bright transient associated 
with GRB 071003 (Schady et al., GCN 6837; Li, GCN 6838) starting at 
07:51 UT on the night of 2007-10-04 using Keck I + LRIS (range 3300-8630 
Angstroms).  Two 10-minute exposures were acquired.

The source is well-detected and a preliminary reduction reveals a smooth 
spectrum consistent with a GRB afterglow with multiple absorption-line 
systems.  We identify a pair of absorption features at 5870 and 5886 
Angstroms with the Mg II 2796, 2803 Angstrom doublet at a redshift of 
1.100.  Other absorption features are consistent with Fe II 2382, 2586, 
and 2599 Angstroms at this redshift.  This absorption system sets a 
lower limit on the redshift of the GRB of z=1.100.

In addition, numerous lines (e.g., Mg II 2796, 2803 Angstroms, Mg I 2852 
Angstroms, and Fe II 2599 Angstroms) are present from an intervening 
absorption system at z=0.372.

No strong supernova features or host-galaxy emission lines are seen in 
the spectrum.

This suggests that the transient is a GRB afterglow undergoing a bright 
late-time optical flare, similar to the afterglow of GRB 070311 (e.g. 
Halpern & Armstrong, GCN 6203; Guidorzi et al., astroph/0708.1383), 
rather than a supernova.  That flare peaked at R~22 approximately two 
days after the burst. Improved photometry of the optical transient 
associated with GRB 071003 gives a magnitude of R = 19.1 +/- 0.3 at 
04:49 UT (0.88 days after the trigger) and further rebrightening appears 
possible. Further monitoring is strongly encouraged.",1.100,1.100,071003,GRB 071003,Keck I,Keck I + LRIS,Spectroscopic,Spectroscopic,2007-10-04 13:11:24.000

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 071003 (Schady et al., GCN 
6837; Li et al. GCN 6838; Cenko et al. GCN 6839) with the ESO-Very Large

a 1800s spectrum with the grism 600B (with a resolution of R = 780) on 
Oct 04.055 UT (~ 0.735 days after the burst), under good seeing 
conditions (1.0"").

The detection of a MgII system at z=1.100 (Perley et al. GCN 6850), 
cannot be confirmed by our data, because the 2803 AA component of the 
MgII doublet is contamined by the NaI 5891 and 5897 AA doublet of the 
nearby bright star.

We also find significant lines at 5417 and 5430 AA, which we interpret 
as the MgII absorption doublet at 2797 and 2803 AA at z=0.937. FeII 2382 
is also detected at the same redshift.

In addition, we find two more significant absorption lines (5417 and 
5446 AA), that can be identified as Ca H and K at z=0.372. 
Alternatively, the 5446 AA line can be interpreted as the  2803 AA 
component of the MgII doublet at z=0.942, with the 2797 AA component 
sharing the absorption feature at 5430 AA with the MgII 2803 of the 
system at z=0.937. This can be another line-locking example like that of 
the CIV system of GRB 021004 at z=2.3 (Fiore et al. 2005, ApJ, 624, 853; 
Starling et al. 2005, MNRAS, 360, 305 ).

Finally, we find another MgII doublet at ~4000 AA (z=0.370), not 
consistent with the Ca system at z=0.372. No emission lines are visible.

In summary our analysis of the FORS2 spectrum puts a lower limit on the 
redshift of GRB 071003 to z=0.937.

both images at the position of the candidate afterglow provided by
Castro-Tirado et al. (GCNs 6968, 6971).

The object has not faded significantly between both epochs, although
the very low S/N (~2) in the first image does not allow for a strong
statement regarding its variability.

Combining our own data and all the available optical-NIR data (GCNs
6962, 6973, 6974, 6975, 6976, 6980, 6983) we have measured a
photometric redshift z~5, but with a 2-sigma confidence interval that
includes all values in the z=[0 ... 5.5] range.

An alternative explanation for all the available data is that of a
strongly reddened afterglow (detected as a fading source in the H- and
K-band images), having taken place in a galaxy at a significantly
lower redshift (detected in our deeper, bluer, R- and z-band
images). This model should be checked via spectroscopy of the putative
host galaxy.

Using FORS1 on the Very Large Telescope, we obtained 
2*20 min spectra (grism 300V+GG375 covering 4000-8000 A) 
of the GRB 060602A host galaxy on 28 December 2006. A firm 
upper limit of z < 2.3 can be placed on the host redshift 
from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in the combined 
spectrum.

We do detect a strong emission line at 6664 A. If it 
corresponds to H-alpha at z = 0.015, we would expect to 
detect H-beta and the [O III] doublet in our spectrum. 
However, no features are visible at their predicted 
locations. In addition, this redshift would imply a very 
faint absolute magnitude of M_R = -10.3.

If the emission line corresponds to [O III] 5008 at 
z = 0.331, we would expect to detect [O II] 3728 which we 
do not. The most probable association is with [O II] 3728, 
corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.787. 

Using the relations by Kennicutt (1998, ARA&A, 36, 189), 
the flux of the proposed [O II] line corresponds to a star 
formation rate (SFR) of approximately 1.9 M_Sun/year. This 
value has not been corrected for host extinction, and is 
therefore a strict lower limit to the actual SFR. The 
specific SFR is around 13.6 M_Sun/year (L/L*)^-1, typical

a star formation rate (SFR) of approximately 0.5 M_Sun/year.
This value has not been corrected for host extinction or slit
loss, and is therefore a strict lower limit to the actual SFR.

The flux ratio of [Ne III] and [O II] is typical of GRB
host galaxies, with log([Ne III]/[O II]) ~ -0.5 (see Fig 4
in Wiersema et al., arXiv:0706.1345v1). The presence of
such strong emission lines in the OA spectrum indicates

while source s2 is indeed pointlike (seeing 0.85""). A faint nebulosity 
is apparent surrounding both objects.

A VLT spectrum was obtained with the FORS1 instrument starting on 2007 
Nov 18.03 UT, placing both sources on the slit. Three exposures of 30 
min each were secured. The afterglow spectrum shows a faint, blue 
continuum between 3700 to 9000 A, and a weak emission line is apparent 
at 8688 A. Interpreting this as [OII], we infer a redshift of z=1.331, 
which we consider as the likely redshift of the GRB. Interpreting the 
observed line as [OIII] or Halpha, we would expect to detect [OII] at 
6466 or 4934 A, respectively, which we do not see. A more conservative 
upper limit to the GRB redshift comes from the nondetection of any

0.1 s, GCN 6365, Tueller et al.) under photometric conditions using the 
Keck I telescope + LRIS, in g and R filters simultaneously for a total 
integration of 930s(g) / 840s(R) under relatively poor seeing.  We 
further imaged the field using GMOS on Gemini-South on 2007-11-27 for 
1200s in r filter under excellent seeing.

The bright source reported by Cucchiara et al. (GCN 6368), designated 
object ""A"" by Antonelli et al. (GCN 6372) and likely the host galaxy of 
the GRB, is well-detected in R and r and weakly detected in g.  Using 
Landolt standard stars we measure an aperture magnitude for this object 
(in a 2.1"" radius aperture) of

g = 24.79 +/- 0.14
R = 23.24 +/- 0.05

This is consistent within errors with the magnitudes reported by 
Cucchiara et al. and Antonelli et al. 4 and 5 hours after the burst, 
respectively.  Image subtraction of the new Gemini imaging versus the 
earlier epoch (GCN 6368) reveals no variability to a limiting magnitude 
of R > 24.5, ruling out an afterglow contribution in the first epoch 
(4.84 hours after the burst) at this level.

Object ""B"" is also detected in both filters, and also shows no evidence 
for variability.


On the night of 2007-10-09 we performed longslit spectroscopy covering 
both targets (""A"" and ""B"") in two integrations of 1500s each, using Keck 
I + LRIS.

The trace of object ""A"" is faint and the spectrum is mostly featureless, 
but a faint line signature is observed centered at 7098 Angstroms, with 
a FWHM of 6 Angstroms.  The feature appears present in both exposures, 
though this site is severely affected by a cosmic ray in one exposure. 
We identify this feature as most likely being the [OII]3727 doublet. 
Other line identifications (H-alpha, H-beta, or [OIII]) are disfavored 
due to the absence of corroborating lines that would be expected over 
our spectral range (3500-8900 Angstroms) in those cases.

Association of this feature with [OII] indicates a redshift for this 
object of z=0.904.  Calibrating relative to R-band photometry, we 
estimate a preliminary line flux of 3e-17 erg/s/cm^2, corresponding to 
an unextincted star formation rate (Kewley et al. 2002) of 0.7 M_sun/yr, 
comparable to that observed in previous short burst hosts.  We note also 
the red color of this galaxy.

This position is consistent with that of the UVOT candidate afterglow

Spectroscopy of the afterglow reveals resonance absorption features from 
several ions, including OI, SiII, CIV, FeII, AlII, AlIII, MgII, MgI, at 
a redshift z = 2.374. The detection of transitions from fine-structure

Folding the data at the X-ray rotational period of 5.769s (ATEL 1677)
revealed no radio pulsations over a wide range of trial dispersion measures
(DMs).  We place an upper limit of 40microJy on a putative radio pulsar at
this epoch, consistent with synthesis upper limits on the radio counterpart
from earlier that day (GCN 8125).  We have also searched a large range of
DMs for individual bright pulses and bursts. No obvious radio bursts were
found down to a time resolution of 3ms and a maximum DM of 1000 pc/cm^3.

Note that during our observation Swift-BAT observed a large burst (on 2008
August 23 14:56:26 UT; ATEL 1678) for which no obvious radio counterpart was
detected.

We are continuing to analyze these data to search for fainter signals.

Westerbork observations are planned starting on 2008 August 26 03:00 (UT) to

We have analyzed more data of our GROND observing run (Rossi et al. 2008, 
GCN #8218) of GRB 080913 (Schady et al. 2008, GCN #8217; Stamatikos et al. 
2008, GCN #8222). The object reported previously is clearly detected in 
several epochs. The position is

RA (2000.0) = 04:22:54.74 
Decl. (2000.) = -25:07:46.2

with an uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec. This position is consistent with the 
astrometrically corrected Swift X-ray position (Beardmore et al. 2008, 
GCN #8219).

z'-band data spanning the time period from 3 min to 3 hrs after the burst
clearly show a fading source and are well fit with a power law
of decay slope 0.6 +- 0.3. This confirms the fading seen with the VLT
(Vreeswijk et al. 2008, GCN #8221). If this fading continues, we predict
z(AB) ~ 25 mag at 24 hrs after the GRB.

The afterglow is detected in z'JHK, but not in g'r'i-bands. After
correction for foreground extinction of A_V=0.129, we obtain (AB system)
g > 23.3 +- 0.1
r > 23.3 +- 0.1

Based on the rapid determination of an i'-band drop out we triggered 
VLT/ToO observations (program-ID 081.A-0135; PI Greiner) and obtained 
spectroscopy with FORS2+Gris600z of the afterglow of GRB080913
(Schady et al. 2008, GCN #8217; Stamatikos et al. 2008, GCN #8222). 
Observations started at 8:30, about 100 min after the GRB, and continued
until morning twilight. We detect a red continuum that disappears
bluewards of a break around 9400 AA. Interpreting this break
as the onset of the Lyman-alpha forest we infer a redshift
of about z=6.7 consistent with the photometric redshift determined
by GROND  (Greiner et al., GCN #8223).

We are very grateful for the excellent support by the Paranal
observatory staff, in particular Rachel Gilmour and Heidi Korhonen.

collaboration:

The afterglow of GRB 080928 detected by Swift (Sakamoto et al., GCN
8292, see also Rykoff et al., GCN 8293) was observed with FORS2
mounted on the Antu telescope of ESO's VLT on Cerro Paranal, Chile.
Following an acquisition image, which was started at 6:31 UT on
September 29, 2008 (15.5 hr after the GRB trigger), a single 1800 s
spectrum was secured. It was taken with a 1"" slit and the 300V grism,
resulting in an approximate resolution of 11 A, and a useful
wavelength coverage of 3800-9300 A. From the 60 s acquisition image,
we measure an afterglow magnitude of R = 20.4 based on USNO-B1
magnitudes.

The extracted spectrum shows a multitude of significant absorption
lines, which we identify with common resonance lines of mainly MgII
and FeII, originating in at least two absorption systems at z=0.735
and z=1.692. The latter redshift presumably corresponds to that of the
GRB host galaxy. We do not find evidence for a spectral break due to
the Lyman alpha forest down to 3800 A, setting a firm upper limit on
the GRB redshift of z < 2.1. These results are consistent with the
redshift limits set by GROND (Rossi et al., GCN 8296) and UVOT (Kuin
et al., GCN 8298), but not with the value of z=2.49 reported by
Cucchiara et al. (GCN 8300).

The equivalent width of the MgII 2796 line of the z=0.735 system
(EW_rest ~ 4.3 A) is much larger than that of the z=1.692 system. We
note the presence of an R ~ 22 object, not covered by the slit, at
2.6"" NNE of the afterglow position, which could possibly be a bright
host galaxy, or the counterpart of the z=0.735 absorber. The slit
serendipitously covers a galaxy 30"" away from the afterglow (at
R.A. 06:20:13.35, decl. -55:11:55.0), which shows an apparent emission
line at 6470 A; this can be identified as [OII] 3727 at a redshift of
z=0.736. At this redshift, 2.6 and 30"" correspond to projected
distances of 19 and 219 kpc, respectively.

We re-processed the data acquired on GRB080928 in order to reconcile our

with the redshift identification reported by Vreesvijk et al. (GCN 8301).

Upon comparison of our two individual exposures, we cannot confirm the

of the metal absorption features reported in GCN 8300.  We therefore 
conclude that
the redshift z=2.49 for GRB 080928 reported by us previously is not

misidentifications are probably the result of inaccurate sky-line and 
sky-fringe
modeling in extraction of the 1D spectrum.  We retract also the claim of 
a DLA

a system at z=1.69, which - as reported by Vreeswijk et al. - represents

We observed the field of GRB 090102 (Mangano et al., GCN 8762) 
with the NOT/ALFOSC starting on Jan 2 at 03:33 (38 minutes after 
the burst onset). The optical afterglow detected by Klotz et al.
(GCN 8761) and Mangano et al. is detected with R ~ 19.6 (based on 
unfiltered images) at the following coordinates (J2000, 0.5"" error):

RA: 08:32:58.54
Dec.: +33:06:51.1

A 45-min low-resolution spectrum was also obained (2 hours post 
burst). A firm upper limit of z < 2.1 can be placed on the 
redshift of GRB 090102 from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in 
the spectrum of the afterglow.

The spectrum also displays several metal lines, including Fe II, 
Mg II, Mg I, Al II, Al III and C IV, at a redshift of z = 1.547.
No other significant lines are visible. We therefore conclude
that z = 1.547 is the redshift of GRB 090102.",1.547,z = 1.547,090102,GRB 090102,NOT,NOT/ALFOSC,No Information,Spectroscopic,2009-01-02 09:29:37.000

Observations started on 03 Feb. 2009 at 05:25 UT, 6.33 h after the burst.

The object reported by D'Avanzo et al. (GCN #8887) is very well detected
in the i' band and redder, marginally in r' and not in g'. A preliminary
i' band magnitude is 20.7 +- 0.2 roughly 7 hours after the burst.
Interpreting the large r'-i' color and the g' band non detection as
Lyman-alpha absorption in the GRB host, we derive a photometric redshift
of 4.7 +- 0.3. This redshift estimate has been obtained using hyperZ
(Bolzonella et al. 2000). We caution that this is based on a preliminary
calibration.

No statement about variability can be made at this point.

using the R400 grating, covering a wavelength range of approximately 
3900 to 8140 Angstroms.  Additional exposures are in progress.

We detect transitions corresponding to C IV, Al II, O I, Si II, Si IV,

Lyman-alpha, at a common redshift of z=3.375.  We also detect Si II* at 
this redshift, identifying this as the redshift of the GRB.  While 
ruling out an association with the bright nearby SDSS galaxy, this 
redshift suggests an extraordinary late-time afterglow luminosity.  We 
continue to encourage sustained late-time follow-up of this event, which 
given its continued brightness (Perley et al., GCN 8985; de Ugarte

et al., GCNC 8979; Mao et al., GCNC 8980) with X-shooter at the ESO
Melipal telescope of the Paranal Observatory. X-shooter is the first
of the second-generation VLT instruments and includes three
Echelle spectrographs, the Ultraviolet/Blue (UVB), the Visible (VIS)
and the Near Infrared (NIR), which combined provide a fixed spectral
format and cover in one shot the spectral range 3000 - 24000 A at
medium spectral resolution (R = 4000 - 10000 depending on the arm
and slit width). The mean epoch of the observation was 45.3 hours
after the burst, when the afterglow had faded to R ~ 21.6 (Perley et
al. GCNC 9001; Cobb et al. GCNC 9008). In the 4 x 1500 s combined
spectrum we clearly detect continuum above 5580 A with several
absorption lines; below this, the signal is dominated by background
emission produced by the nearby Moon (90 % illumination at 37 deg
from the field). The spectrum indicates an absorption redshift
of z = 3.3721  0.0004 (consistent with that measured by Chornock et
al., GCNC 8994 and Thoene et al., GCNC 9012) through the detection of

Mg II (2796.3, 2803.5) and Mg I (2853.0). The intervening system
identified by Thoene et al. (GCNC 9012) is resolved into multiple
components through the detection of Fe II, Mg II and Mg I lines with
its main absorption at redshift 1.800. A further system at z = 1.959
shows Fe II, Mg II and Mg I absorption.

The spectra of GRB 090313 will be made public on the ESO web as other

A preliminary analysis of the combined spectrum shows a very weak signal 
at the position of the NIR afterglow. No signal is observed below 
observed lambda ~ 10500 Angstrom. Assuming that the lack of signal at 
bluer wavelengths is due to Ly-alpha absorption in the IGM this gives a 
redshift of z ~ 7.6 (in agreement with the estimate of Olivares et al., 
GCN 9215). We point out that our wavelength calibration is based on an

We detect in the spectrum flux at wavelengths lambda>1.1 microns, and a

Hoversten, GCN 9332;  Olofsson et al., GCN 9338;  Olivares et al., GCN
9352) started  on May  12 08:17UT.  A  total of three  30min exposures
with the 300I grism  were obtained, covering an approximate wavelength
range of 6000-10000 Angstroms.

Preliminary analysis of the spectra reveals two emission lines at 7093
and 9250 Angstroms,  which we identify as [OII] and  Hbeta at a common
redshift of z=0.903 +/- 0.003. Furthermore, there are indications of a
spectral break  in the continuum  around 7600 Angstroms,  suggesting a
possible 4000A break at the same redshift.

The detection of  emission lines and the possible  4000A break suggest
the dominance of the underlying  host galaxy over the afterglow at the
time of our observations. It also confirms that host galaxies of short
GRBs are not  all old and dead ellipticals but  instead drawn from the
underlying  field galaxy  distribution (e.g.,  Berger 2009,  ApJ, 690,
231).

In the  acquisition image the center  of the host is  0.7"" offset with
respect to the NOT refined afterglow position, which corresponds to 5.5 
kpc at a
z=0.903.

At a redshift of z=0.903, the isotropic equivalent energy of the burst
is  3.8E52 erg in the 1 keV - 10 MeV rest  frame (using  the Fermi/GBM
spectral parameters of Guiriec et  al., GCN 9336).  The peak energy of
the best fit  GBM Band function model  is 8.4 +/- 0.8 MeV  in the rest
frame.

This is therefore likely to be the redshift of the GRB but we note that
