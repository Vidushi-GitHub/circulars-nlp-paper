SEDM team:

We observed the optical counterpart to GRB 190613A (Ambrosi et al., GCN
24798) with the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) on the 60 inch
telescope at Palomar Observatory. The SEDM is a low resolution (R ~ 100)
integral field unit spectrometer with a multi-band (ugri) rainbow camera imager
(see Blagorodnova et al. 2018, PASP, 130, 035003, and Rigault et al. 2019,
astro-ph/1902.08526).

The SEDM began observing the optical counterpart at 04:18:22 UTC (8.75
minutes after the burst trigger time). We performed an 1800 s exposure over the
wavelength range 3800-9200 A. The continuum emission is well-fit by a power
law spectrum with index alpha = 0.56 (f_nu ~ nu^-alpha).  We detect an
absorption line at an observed wavelength of ~ 4597 A. We tentatively identify
this line as due to Lyman alpha at z = 2.78 - however due to the lack of
corroborating features we consider this redshift tentative currently.

Spectra of the optical transient associated with GRB 010222 (GCN # 959, 961)
have been obtained on 23.61 February UT by H. Ebeling, using the Echelle 
Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) on the Keck-II 10-m telescope.  Preliminary 
analysis shows the following:

We confirm the existence of 3 absorption systems reported earlier (GCN # 965,
974, 989), with improved heliocentric redshifts as follows:

(1) z_abs = 1.4768 +- 0.0002  (based on 22 metallic lines)
    This system, presumably associated with the host galaxy, appears to 
    have some kinematic substructure, possibly with two distinct systems at
    z_1 = 1.47667 +- 0.00005  and  z_2 = 1.47755 +- 0.00005, i.e., with a
    restframe velocity separation of 106 km/s, typical for internal motions
    in galaxies.  The equivalent widths of the lines are unusually strong
    in comparison to metallic line absorbers seen in the spectra of quasars,
    indicating a high column density of gas, probably consistent with a
    star-forming region environment.

(2) z_abs = 1.1561 +- 0.0001  (based on 9 metallic lines)

(3) z_abs = 0.9274 +- 0.0001  (based on 5 metallic lines)

Systems (2) and (3) are typical for the metallic line absorbers at 
comparable redshifts.  Detection of two such foreground systems is not 
unusual.  Further analysis of the data is in progress.

We have observed the field of GRB 090814A (Ukwatta et al. GCN 9793)
using FORS2 at the VLT (Paranal observatory) starting at 02:05 UT
(70 minutes after the burst). We detect the object identified by  
Updike et
al. (GCN 9794) with a magnitude of R~21.5.

The spectrum shows continuum down to at least 3900 Angstroms.
Non detection of Ly-alpha implies a limit of z < 2.2. We identify a
weak absorption system at z=0.696 through the detection of MgII and  
CaII.
This is therefore likely to be the redshift of the GRB but we note that
it could also be produced by an intervening system and thus the strict
redshift range for this GRB would be 0.696 < z < 2.2.

A spectrum of the optical transient (GCN 961, 962, and 963) associated
with GRB010222 (GCN 959, 960) was obtained with the F. L. Whipple
Observatory 1.5m Tillinghast telescope (+ FAST spectrograph) on 2001
February 22 beginning at UT 12:18, 4.92 hours after the burst.  Two
1200s spectra were obtained with a 3 arcsec wide slit and 300 l/mm
grating, yielding 6 Angstrom resolution over the range from 3620 to
7560 A. The OT was approximately R=18.4 mag around the time of the
spectroscopy (GCN 963).

This spectrum shows a blue continuum and many narrow absorption lines
with the following preliminary identifications:

Observed	Line		Rest		Redshift

The FeII (2585,2599) and MgII (2796,2803) doublet absorption features
are strong, absorbing approximately 50 and 80% of the continuum at
those wavelengths.  These absorption lines constrain the redshift of
the optical transient associated with GRB010222 to be at >= 1.476.  If
the lines come from a host galaxy associated with the GRB, then the
redshift is 1.476.

Additional unidentified absorption lines appear in the spectrum, data

A preliminary analysis of the combined spectrum shows a very weak signal 
at the position of the NIR afterglow. No signal is observed below 
observed lambda ~ 10500 Angstrom. Assuming that the lack of signal at 
bluer wavelengths is due to Ly-alpha absorption in the IGM this gives a

format and cover in one shot the spectral range 3000 - 24000 A at
medium spectral resolution (R = 4000 - 10000 depending on the arm
and slit width). The mean epoch of the observation was 45.3 hours
after the burst, when the afterglow had faded to R ~ 21.6 (Perley et

spectrum we clearly detect continuum above 5580 A with several
absorption lines; below this, the signal is dominated by background
emission produced by the nearby Moon (90 % illumination at 37 deg

of z = 3.3721  0.0004 (consistent with that measured by Chornock et

A 45-min low-resolution spectrum was also obained (2 hours post

redshift of GRB 090102 from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in

The spectrum also displays several metal lines, including Fe II,

We performed the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis
of GRB 080913 (Swift/BAT trigger #324561: Schady et al., GCN Circ. 8217,
Stamatikos et al. GCN Circ. 8222).
Since the Konus-Wind observed this GRB in the waiting mode, we only
have 3 channel spectral data for the Konus-Wind which cover the energy
range from 20 keV to 1.3 MeV.  Therefore, the joint spectral analysis of
the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data enables to derive the broad-band
spectral parameters of this burst.

The time interval of the spectral data for each instrument is chosen
from  T0(BAT)-4.1 to T0(BAT)+4.7 sec where T0(BAT) is the trigger time
of BAT at 06:46:54.1 UTC.  The energy ranges which we used in the joint
spectral analysis are 20-1300 keV and 14-150 keV for the Konus-Wind and
the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of two instruments are
fit with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to take
into account the systematic effective area uncertainties in the response
matrices of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fit with a power-law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). The constant factors of each
instrument agree within 5%.  No systematic residual from the best fit
model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  The best fit
spectral parameters are: alpha = -0.89(-0.46, +0.65) and Epeak = 131
(-48/+225) keV (chi2/dof = 43.7/58).  The best fit spectral parameters
for the Band function fixing beta=-2.5 are: alpha = -0.82(-0.53, +0.75)
and Epeak = 121 (-39/+232) keV (chi2/dof = 43.9/58).  The energy fluence
in the 15-1000 keV band calculated by a power-law with exponential
cutoff model for this 8.8 sec interval is 8.5(-2.2, +6.0)x10^-7 erg/cm2

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

Assuming z = 6.7 (Fynbo et al., GCN Circ. 8225) and a standard cosmology
model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27, Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the
isotropic energy  release is E_iso ~7x10^52 erg in 1 keV to 10 MeV at
the GRB rest frame extrapolating the best Band function fit fixing
beta=-2.5.

Looking only at the parameters of the prompt emission, namely T90~1 sec
and Ep ~900 keV in the GRB rest frame, this burst could be classified as
a short burst.",z = 6.7,GRB 080913,Swift-BAT and Konus-Wind,Spectroscopic,6.7

redshift is z = 2.0369 +- 0.0007, presumably corresponding to the system
identified by Fynbo et al. (GCN 807) as having z ~ 2.066.  However, we see 
no evidence for any other absorption systems in these data; in particular, 
the ostensible system at z = 1.378 proposed by Fynbo et al. is likely due to
line misidentifications.

We note that the line equivalent widths appear to be unusually strong in
comparison to the general population of metallic line absorbers seen in the
spectra of quasars, suggesting a high column density and/or metallicity of
the intervening gas.  A more detailed analysis is in progress.

several USNO-B1 stars (R1 magnitudes) yields R = 20.0 +/- 0.2, where most
of the error comes from the calibration. Using the R-band magnitude
provided by Chen et al., the inferred decay index is alpha ~ 0.9.

Low resolution spectra (3 x 30 min) were also obtained. The combined
spectrum displays a strong absorption feature around 4350 A, with the flux
dropping substantially blueward of this feature. Associating it with
Ly-alpha gives a redshift of z ~ 2.6 for the burst. We find several other

Using FORS2 on the Very Large Telescope, we have obtained a 10 min
spectrum (grism 300V) of the optical afterglow of GRB 080210 (Grupe et
al., GCN 7281).

The acquisition image shows the UVOT optical afterglow candidate to
have R = 18.8 on Feb 10.351 UT (0.597 hours after the GRB) using
photometric zeropoints from the ESO webpages. We also obtained an
R-band image at 1.65 hours after the GRB indicating a decay index of
0.76 +/- 0.04.

The spectrum is rich in absorption features, including Ly-alpha, Si II, 
C II, Si IV, C IV, Fe II and Al II, corresponding to a redshift of
z = 2.641. This is consistent with the redshift upper limit (z < 3.5)
reported by GROND (Kuepcue Yoldas et al., GCN 7283). There is also a
tentative detection of Ly-alpha in emission superimposed on the DLA

report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have flux calibrated the VLT spectrum of the GRB 071112C
optical afterglow (Jakobsson et al., GCN 7076). We clearly
detect four emission lines: [O II] 3727, [Ne III] 3869 and
[O III] 4960,5008. Using the relations by Kennicutt (1998,
ARA&A, 36, 189), the flux of the [O II] line corresponds to
a star formation rate (SFR) of approximately 0.5 M_Sun/year.
This value has not been corrected for host extinction or slit
loss, and is therefore a strict lower limit to the actual SFR.

The flux ratio of [Ne III] and [O II] is typical of GRB
host galaxies, with log([Ne III]/[O II]) ~ -0.5 (see Fig 4
in Wiersema et al., arXiv:0706.1345v1). The presence of
such strong emission lines in the OA spectrum indicates
a fairly bright host, approximately 24 < R < 25 (see also
Nugent & Bloom, GCN 7069).

Finally, using new wavelength calibration files we report
a more accurate absorption redshift (based on 8 lines):

""We observed the field of GRB 071021 (Sakamoto et al. GCN 6958) with  
PAIRITEL (*) starting at 2007-10-22 04:53 UT in high wind and poor  
seeing conditions at Mt Hopkins, Arizona. In the first 1340 second  
stack, the IR source noted by Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN 6968/6971) is  
not detected to J=18.35 mag, H=16.87 mag, Ks=16.43 (2.5 sigma upper  
limit). This is not particularly constraining in light of the deep  
Subaru imaging (Terada et al. GCN 6976) at a similar epoch.

  We note that despite the z-band detection (Malesani et al. GCN  
#6972) the very high-redshift hypothesis of Sakamoto et al. (GCN  
6967) is not yet ruled out. In particular, in high z QSO spectra  
there can be some transmitted flux (in the z-band filter  
transmission) through the Lyman-alpha forest between ~8000 Ang and  
8500 Ang (see, e.g., Fan et al. 2006 **) for z > 6.3 sources. So long  
as the redshifted Lyman limit at the redshift of the emitting source  
is blueward of ~8500 Ang, this light would not be entirely  
suppressed. This consideration yields an upper limit:

                         (1 + z_GRB)*912 Ang < 8500 Ang
                                     z_GRB <~ 8.3

  At such redshifts, say z_GRB = 8, all reported long-wavelength  
observations to-date would be naturally accommodated:

  - the deep non-detections at R and i-band (Berger & Covarrubias,  
GCNs 6973,6974), being blueward of 912*[1+z_GRB])
   - the faint detection at z-band (GCN 6972) due transmitted flux  
between 912*[1+z_GRB] = 8200 and 8500 Ang is allowed (as above)
   - the afterglow detections at H and K (GCN 6968; Terada et al. GCN  
6976)
   - the apparent faintness of J-band flux (GCN 6968) relative to H  
and K given the Gunn-Peterson trough would extend to (1 + z_GRB)*1216  
Ang =~ 1.1 micron.

  All of this assumes that the z-band source is not a foreground  
galaxy (in which case a higher-z GRB suggested by Castro-Tirado et  
al. is allowed).  If indeed the GRB originated from z > 7, we would  
expect to see what would resemble emission lines between lam_obs =  
912*[1+z_GRB] and ~8500 Ang, motivating the utility of *optical*  
spectroscopy of this source. Even without spectroscopy, when final  
magnitudes are reported along with filter transmission curves, a full  
SED should be illuminating.""

Hence, the GRB is unrelated to the nearby z = 0.0166 galaxy

We note that this is a lower limit to the GRB redshift.
There is some indication of a flux drop in the OA spectrum

We obtained spectroscopic follow-up of the bright transient associated 
with GRB 071003 (Schady et al., GCN 6837; Li, GCN 6838) starting at 
07:51 UT on the night of 2007-10-04 using Keck I + LRIS (range 3300-8630 
Angstroms).  Two 10-minute exposures were acquired.

The source is well-detected and a preliminary reduction reveals a smooth 
spectrum consistent with a GRB afterglow with multiple absorption-line 
systems.  We identify a pair of absorption features at 5870 and 5886 
Angstroms with the Mg II 2796, 2803 Angstrom doublet at a redshift of 
1.100.  Other absorption features are consistent with Fe II 2382, 2586, 
and 2599 Angstroms at this redshift.  This absorption system sets a 
lower limit on the redshift of the GRB of z=1.100.

In addition, numerous lines (e.g., Mg II 2796, 2803 Angstroms, Mg I 2852 
Angstroms, and Fe II 2599 Angstroms) are present from an intervening 
absorption system at z=0.372.

No strong supernova features or host-galaxy emission lines are seen in 
the spectrum.

This suggests that the transient is a GRB afterglow undergoing a bright 
late-time optical flare, similar to the afterglow of GRB 070311 (e.g. 
Halpern & Armstrong, GCN 6203; Guidorzi et al., astroph/0708.1383), 
rather than a supernova.  That flare peaked at R~22 approximately two 
days after the burst. Improved photometry of the optical transient 
associated with GRB 071003 gives a magnitude of R = 19.1 +/- 0.3 at 
04:49 UT (0.88 days after the trigger) and further rebrightening appears 
possible. Further monitoring is strongly encouraged.",1.100,GRB 071003,Keck I + LRIS,Spectroscopic,1.1

070521 detected by Swift (GCN Circ 6431, C. Guidorzi et al.), during the
main period of emission lasting 60s (GCN Circ 6440, D. Palmer et al.).

No evidence for prompt GeV/TeV emission was found. TeV photons are
attenuated by pair production with infrared photons in intergalactic
space. We calculate an upper limit assuming two possible values for the
redshift: z=0.03 (GCN Circ 6433, E. O. Ofek et al.), and z=0.55 (GCN Circ
6444, T. Hattori et al.) using the extragalactic infrared background light
(EBL) absorption model of Primack et al. 2005 (AIP Conf. Proc. 745, p.

A preliminary analysis, assuming a differential photon spectral
index of -2.4, gives upper limits on E^2dN/dE at 99% confidence of:

E^2 dN/dE at 250 GeV < 3.5 * 10^(-7) erg cm^(-2) (Assuming z=0.03)

R ~ 22.0 on May 8.337 (3.79 hours post-burst).

The combined spectrum does not display any obvious absorption 
features. However, a firm upper limit of z < 2.3 can be placed on 
the redshift of GRB 070508 from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in 
the spectrum of the afterglow. This is consistent with the UVOT 
observations (Marshall & Grupe, GCN 6392).

We do detect a tentative emission line at 6781 A. If it corresponds 
to H-alpha at z = 0.033, we would expect to detect H-beta and the

fitted with a power law of spectral index beta = -1.1 witn no obvious

E(B-V) = 0.05 (cf GCN 585). The flux level is around 2.5E-17 ergs/cm2/sec/A. 
This puts any possible Lyman break at wavelengths shorter than 318 nm.  
The object is thus at a redshift lower than 2.5. This is consistent with 
the report by Smette et al. (GCN 603).

The spectrum may reveal two absorption features at 336.0 nm and 
352.2 nm.  If identified with Lyman alpha, the redshifts of these features

We confirm the absence of prominent absorption features noted in

Moderately high resolution spectra (FWHM ~ 1 Ang) of the optical transient

2000 March 04, by W. L. W. Sargent, A. Boksenberg, and M. Rauch, using the 
ESI Echelle spectrograph on the Keck-II 10-m telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
Two exposures of 1800 sec each were obtained, over an effective wavelength 
range from ~3800 Ang, to ~10800 Ang.  The OT continuum is well detected.

No strong absorption systems were found in the spectrum.  However, a number
of possible weak lines are present.  We identify a subset of them with the
following lines: Fe II 2260, 2344, 2374, 2382, 2586, and 2600, and Mg II 2796 
and 2803; and a less reliable set of O I 1302, C II 1334, Si IV 1393, 
Si II 1526, C IV 1550, Fe II 1608, Al II 1670.  The weighted mean absorption 
redshift of this 16-line system is z = 2.0335 +- 0.0003.

This is fully consistent with the redshift estimate from the HST spectroscopy, 
z = 1.95 +- 0.1 (Smette et al., GCN 603), based on the ostensible Lyman break.
We thus consider our redshift determination to be secure, and interpret it as 
the redshift of the GRB host galaxy, with no intervening foreground systems.

The restframe equivalent widths of the absorption lines are in the range of
interstellar medium in the host galaxy.

Assuming z = 2.0335, and a simple Friedmann cosmology with H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, 
Omega_0 = 0.2, and Lambda_0 = 0, the luminosity distance is D_L = 5.11e28 cm, 
the distance modulus is (m-M) = 49.1 mag, and the relativistic (1+z)**4 
surface brightness dimming factor is 4.8 mag.  This may account for the lack 
of a detection of the host galaxy in the HST images (Fruchter et al., GCN 602).

instruments. Observations were clustered around 2005 Jan 18.1 UT.

The afterglow is clearly detected in the J, H and K filters, and is seen 
to decline achromatically in J and K, comparing our new measurements 
with those secured during the night of Jan 16 (D'Avanzo et al., GCN

The object is also detected in the z band, but is not seen in the I and 
R filters.

By fitting the available photometry with a power law suppressed by 
neutral Hydrogen absorption, we measure a photometric redshift z = 6.7 
and z = 6.6 for the first and second night, respectively. Combining 
together the two datasets, we get z = 6.60, the 1-sigma confidence 
interval being 6.45 < z < 6.75. The observed NIR spectral index 
(rest-frame UV) is quite steep, indicating
significant extinction in the rest frame.

GRB 060116 may thus be the farthest observed GRB, and rank among the 
most distant objects detected to date in the Universe.

""We have further analyzed the Keck/HIRES spectrum of GRB 051111.
A total integration of 5400s was acquired covering 4200-8400Ang
with a SNR~20 per 1.3km/s pixel at 5500Ang.  The main component
is ~30km/s wide, contains 90% of the gas and is centered at
z=1.54948 +/- 0.00001.  The full line-profile, however, spans
~250km/s.

The gas in the GRB host is remarkable for several reasons:
(1) The SiII 1808 and ZnII 2026, 2062 transitions are saturated
implying log N(Zn) > 13.5 and log N(Si) > 15.9.  We believe these are
the largest Zn and Si column densities recorded outside the Local Group;
(2) The observed Zn/Fe ratio is [Zn/Fe] > 1.2 indicating significant
differential depletion;  (3) We detect the fine-structure SiII* 1816
transition and observe that the weak MgI 2026 transition is saturated.
(4) Perhaps more stunning, we detect nearly every FeII excited  
transition
in the Morton catalog redward of 2300Ang.  This includes several
transitions from the 977K excited level.  These suggest both a large
volume density and a warm gas.

We place a lower limit to N(HI) assuming a solar metallicity for
the gas: log N(HI) > 20.8.  The high metal column density and
significant differential depletion imply a rest-frame V-band
extinction A(V) > 0.5mag.  Adopting the Milky Way extinction curve,
this implies an observed R-band extinction A(R_obs) > 1.4mag.
The extinction is several times larger if one adopts the SMC or
Calzetti curves.

We also identify a very strong intervening MgII system at z=1.18975.

In the acquisition image the afterglow is detected at an AB magnitude of r = 21.00 +/- 0.03, as compared to PanSTARRS field stars.

The spectrum shows a clear continuum over the complete spectral range with multiple absorption features that we identify as Ly-alpha, SII, OI, SiII, SiII*, CII, SiIV, CIV, FeII, FeII*, AlII, AlIII at a common redshift of z = 2.163, which we identify as the redshift of the GRB. We also note the presence of a prominent emission of Lyman alpha.

We observed the optical counterpart (Parsotan et al., GCN 40292; Odeh et al., GCN 40295) of GRB 250430A / EP250430a (Parsotan et al., GCN 40292; Wang et al., GCN 40299) with the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000 - 21000 AA, and consist of 4 exposures of 600 s each. The observation mid time was 2025 May 01 at 04:00:11 UT (10.87 hr after the Swift/BAT trigger).

In a 3x30-s image, taken in the r band at a mid time of 10.34 hr after the trigger, the optical counterpart is detected at RA, Dec 233.3872, -18.1184 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000) = 15:33:32.93
Dec (J2000) = -18:07:06.3

These coordinates are in good agreement with those reported by Odeh et al. (GCN 40295). We measure a preliminary AB magnitude r = 21.97 +/- 0.06, calibrated against nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog.

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we observe a continuum over the entire covered wavelength range, fainter in the UVB and VIS arms than in the NIR. A few absorption features are detected, which we interpret as the Mg II doublet (2796, 2804) and Fe II (2374, 2383, 2587, 2600), all at the common redshift z = 0.767. No emission lines are observed across the whole covered spectrum.

We note the presence of a catalogued object in the Legacy Survey DR10 at a position consistent with the optical afterglow. The magnitudes of the galaxy are g = 24.59 +/- 0.25, r = 23.22 +/- 0.10, i = 21.96 +/- 0.05, and z = 21.35 +/- 0.04, and its centroid is 0.5"" away from the optical afterglow position. Our spectroscopic redshift measurement is consistent with the photometric redshift value provided of 0.89 +/- 0.11. This object is the likely host galaxy of GRB 250430A, though we notice that its red colors and lack of emission lines are not typical of a long (collapsar) GRB host.

We observed the near-infrared candidate counterpart (Malesani et al., GCN 39727) of the long SVOM/ECLAIRs GRB 250314A (Wang et al., GCN 39719) at the ESO VLT, using the HAWK-I near-infrared imager (on UT4, Kueyen) and the X-shooter spectrograph (on UT3, Melipal).

The object is well detected in the Y, J and H filters. HAWK-I observations started on 2025 Mar 15 at 05:23:28 UT (about 16.5 hr after the GRB). We measure preliminary AB magnitudes:

Y = 23.2 +/- 0.15
J = 22.4 +/- 0.1
H = 22.5 +/- 0.1

For the spectra, the observation mid time was 2025 Mar 15.26 UT (about 17.4 hr after the GRB). The data cover the wavelength range 3000-21,000 AA and consist of 4 exposures of 1200 s each.

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, a faint continuum is confidently detected all across the NIR arm (down to 10,300 AA). Tentative signal is also seen in the very red end of the VIS arm, with a drop around 10,090 AA. While the S/N is too low to confidently identify individual metal absorption features, the break in the VIS is consistent with the onset of the Lyman forest (with possible contribution from damped Lyman-alpha absorption in the GRB host galaxy). The implied redshift is z ~ 7.3.

The HAWK-I photometry is consistent with a break, rather than with a generically red shape of the continuum, given the red Y-J vs blue J-H color, consistent with the Y filter being partly dropped out. Assuming a power law model (no dust extinction), a fit to the available photometry provides a redshift z = 7.21 +0.18 -0.38 (1 sigma c.l.), fully consistent with the spectroscopic value.

Following the detection of the optical afterglow (Rastinejad et al., GCN 38855) of GRB 250108B  (Klinger et al., GCN 38847), we obtained optical spectroscopy using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS-N) mounted on Gemini-North, under Program GN-2024B-Q-107 (P.I. Rastinejad). The mean time of the observation was 15:12 UT on 2025 Jan 8 (4.81 hr post-burst). The total exposure time was 4x400 s using the R400 grating, which covers the wavelength range 4650-9450 AA.

Given the faintness of the target (r ~ 23.4; Rastinejad et al., GCN 38855), only a weak trace is detected, with most of the signal apparent at the red end of the spectrum. A few absorption features are weakly detected. A possible redshift solution, based on the detection of Mg I 2852, Mg II 2796,2803, Fe II 2600, and Fe II 2586, yields z = 2.197, which we suggest to be the redshift of GRB 250108B.

The observation was conducted using the GMG-2.4m telescope with Grism #14, which provides a wavelength coverage of 3600–7460 AA. A single 1800s spectrum was obtained, with exposure beginning at 14:24:54.5 UT on 2025-01-01, about 1.03 hours after the Swift trigger.

The Ly-alpha absorption feature at ~ 4250 AA is evident. Despite the low signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, we identified multiple metal absorption lines: Si II at 1303 AA, C II at 1335 AA, Si IV at 1394 AA, Si IV at 1403 AA, C IV at 1549 AA, Al II at 1671 AA, Al III at 1855 AA, and Al III at 1863 AA. These metal absorption features consistently indicate a redshift of z ~ 2.481, which is consistent with the Xinglong-2.16m result (Zhu et al., GCN 38759).

We acknowledge the staff at the Lijiang Observatory for conducting the observation.

We performed ESO VLT/X-shooter spectroscopic observations of the VLT/FORS2 candidate counterpart (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 38484) of GRB 241209A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 38474; Parsotan et al., GCN 38476). Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA, and consist of 4 exposures of 600 s each. The observation mid-time was 2024 Dec 9.302 UT (1.66 hr after the GRB).

From a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we do not detect any continuum. Emission lines are detected in the visible and near-infrared arms, which we identify as Halpha, [OIII] 5007 AA and the [OII] 3726, 3729 AA doublet at a common redshift of z = 1.490. No absorption lines are identified due to the faintness of the source (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 38484) and the low S/N of the spectra.

We notice that the recently released UVOT-enhanced X-ray position (Evans et al., GCN 38486) encompasses both this object and the brighter galaxy mentioned by de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN 38484), making it unclear which one, if any, is the GRB counterpart. The brighter galaxy has of course a smaller chance association probability.

We encourage further photometric observation to detect the variability of any of these two sources.

We used the FORS2 spectrograph mounted on the ESO VLT UT1 (Antu), equipped with grisms 300V (without order-sorting filter) and 300I (with filter OG590). The exposure time was 600 s per grism. Spectroscopy started on 2024 November 6.133 UT (about 11.08 hr after the trigger), and was carried out through moderately good seeing conditions (1"").

In the acquisition image, we measure a preliminary magnitude R = 20.10 +/- 0.10 (Vega), calibrated using archival FORS2 zeropoints.

From a preliminary reduction of the 300V spectrum, a continuum is detected over the wavelength range 4600 to 8700 AA. A trough due to Lya absorption is visible at the blue end. From the detection of multiple absorption features, which we interpret as due to C II, C IV, Si II, Si IV, Al II, Al III and Fe II, we infer a redshift of z = 2.681.

mean metallicity of damped Lya system at this redshift.  More  
strikingly,
we identify fine-structure lines of SiII*, OI*, OI**, and FeII*, the

collaboration:

We have obtained GMOS/R400 spectroscopy (2400s) of the Sources
identified as A, B and D in GCN #3672.  We confirm
the identification of Source B as a Galactic star
(GCN #3675).  We tentatively identify Source A as a
Galactic star based on its PSF and featureless spectrum.

Our acquisition image of the field clearly demonstrates
that Source D is extended and therefore a galaxy.  Our
spectrum of the galaxy is nearly featureless
(lambda=5000-9000A), indicating the galaxy is an early
type consistent with its red color (GCN #3673).
We assign a possible redshift of z=0.257 based on
absorption features at ~6510A and ~7415A which we
associate with MgI and NaI.  The galaxy is located
7.2"" from the refined XRT position (GCN #3678) which
would correspond to 27kpc at z=0.257.

We obtained 3x900s exposures under bad seeing conditions (1.9 arcsec) using the R1000B grism, which gives a wavelength coverage between 3700 and 7800 A. At the time of observations, the afterglow had a magnitude of r~20.2 as determined from the acquisition image.

In the combined spectrum we detect the MgII 2796,2803 Å doublet and faint lines of FeII 2585 and 2600 Å, which results in a redshift of z=1.179. TNG (D’Avanzo et al. GCN 35007) also claims the detection of a MgII doublet, however, at their reported redshift of z=1.39, no lines are present in our spectrum. No fine-structure lines are detected, making the redshift of 1.179 strictly seen as a lower limit. However, given the lack of further emission or absorption features in the spectral range and the upper limit of z~2 due to the detection of continuum down to 3650 Å (similar to the claim of D'Avanzo et al.

Observations started at 23:53:33 UT on 2023-08-18, i.e., 26 min post-burst, and 2x1200 s spectra were obtained, with a spectral coverage of 3600 - 9500 AA.

The spectrum shows a trace throughout the whole range, with a broad absorption feature at ~ 4150 AA, which can be interpreted as Lya at z~2.4. Redward several prominent absorption features are present, which can be interpreted as due to Si II, O I, C II, Si IV, C IV, Ni II, Fe II at a common redshift of z = 2.42, being consistent with the Lya feature. We thus think this is the redshift of the burst.

After the spectroscopy, an 150 s exposure in the Sloan i-band was obtained. We measured m(i) = 20.02 +/- 0.02 at 1.21 hr post-burst, calibrated with nearby SDSS stars.

""In addition to the JWST/NIRCam observations of GRB 230307A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 33405) reported in GCN 33569, we also obtained observations with NIRSpec on 5 April 2023. The observations were obtained for a total integration time of approximately 1 hour, using the prism to obtain a spectrum in the range 0.5-5.5 um. The trace confirms the spectral shape measured from NIRCam observations. Blueward of 2 um, the source has a flat spectrum, but low signal to noise, and a strong upturn redward of 2 um. 

We note the presence of two weak, narrow emission features in the spectrum, both of which are offset from the trace by approximately 0.1-0.2"". These are consistent with the H-alpha and [O III] (5007 AA) emission lines at z = 3.87. Excess flux in the spectrum is also visible at the location of H-beta at this redshift. If the GRB is from a low redshift merger, as suggested by GCN 33569, then this could only be explained by a chance alignment with an unrelated background galaxy. It is hard to quantify this possibility, given that we could be seeing both transient and galaxy light, however the chances are clearly low.

Alternatively, the lines could be from the host galaxy, implying that GRB 230307A lies at z = 3.87. The very red colours of the continuum source would not naturally match the expectations of any afterglow models at z = 3.87, but in fact could be consistent with those of a dusty, red galaxy. Given only one epoch in the mid-IR is available, we cannot rule out this possibility, although such a galaxy would be extremely compact, and the transient would have to decay very steeply since the last ground-based observations. We note that, at this redshift, GRB 230307A would be by far the most energetic burst ever detected, with E_iso ~ 10^56 erg. This would be an order of magnitude more energetic than any of the ~500 GRBs with available isotropic energy releases.

We observed the location of GRB 211227A (Beardmore et al., GCN 31316) 
using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter 
spectrograph. Short images were secured with the acquisition camera in 
the g, r, and z filters. No new object is detected inside the revised 
XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN 31322) down to an AB magnitude r > 
24.7 (mean time Dec 28.191 UT).

The galaxy mentioned by Fu et al. (GCN 31320) is well detected in our 
image. Its core lies 3.66"" away of the center of the XRT circle (2.4"" 
90% error radius), though its wings extend towards it.

A spectrum of this object was secured, covering the wavelength range 
3000-21000 AA, and consisting of 4 exposures of 600 s each. The 
observation mid time was 2021 Dec 28.21 UT (5.60 hr after the GRB). We 
detect several emission lines, which we interpret as due to [O II], 
Hbeta, [O III] 5007, Halpha, [N II], [S II] all at a common redshift z = 
0.228. Absorption features due to Ca II 3933/3968 and the Na I D doublet 
5890/5896 are also visible at the same redshift. This value is 
consistent with the SDSS photometric redshift. The galaxy is fairly 
bright, with an absolute magnitude M_r ~ -21.3 (AB) using i = 18.84 (AB) 
from SDSS.

We point out the similarity of the gamma-ray light curve of GRB 211227A 
(e.g. https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1091101/BA/) with that of GRB 
060614 (e.g. Gehrels et al. 2006, Nature, 444, 1044), suggested by some 
authors to be a merger event (e.g. Yang et al. 2015, Nat. Comm., 6, 
7323). The location of the GRB, slightly offset from a bright, nearby 
galaxy, would also be consistent with this interpretation. We raise the 
possibility that GRB 211227A is a short GRB with extended emission. 
However, a long GRB, either hosted by the z = 0.228 galaxy, or in the 
background, remains a viable possibility.

We encourage further observations of this potentially interesting event 
at all wavelengths.

We observed the field of GRB 220117A (Melandri et al., GCN 31466) using 
the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Our 
first observations were carried out using the acquisition camera, using 
the g, r and z filters (3x60 s in each band). Inside the XRT error 
circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 31472), we detect a new source, not 
visible in the archival Pan-STARRS images, which we identify as the GRB 
afterglow. The source is very red, being detected strongly in z, only 
weakly in r, and completely missing in g. Calibrated against nearby 
stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog, we measure z = 20.81 +- 0.12 mag and 
z - r ~ 2.1 mag (all AB magnitudes). The afterglow coordinates are 
(J2000, 0.2"" error):

consisting of 4 exposures of 1200 s each. The observation mid time was 
2022 Jan 18.15 UT (11.3 hr after the GRB).

In a preliminary reduction, continuum is detected in the red part of the 
spectrum down to ~7260 AA. We interpret the break as due to Lyman alpha. 
The absorption system is rather weak and, at the present time, we 
identify with confidence only the Lyman-alpha trough and the Si II 1260

A very clear trace is detected from the afterglow continuum. A deep, 
broad trough is detected around 6800 AA, which we interpret as due to 
damped Lyman alpha. A number of narrow absorption features are also 
clearly visible and allow to determine accurately the GRB redshift. We 
identify, among others, N V, S II, Si II, Si II*, O I, Ni II, C II, Si

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 211211A (D'Ai et al., GCN 
31202; Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 31203) using the Nordic Optical Telescope 
(NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC instrument. Images were secured in the 
SDSS r, g and i filters.

At the mean time of Dec 12.24 UT (16.6 hr after the GRB), we measure a 
magnitude r = 20.89 +- 0.05 AB, calibrated against nearby stars from the 
Pan-STARRS survey. Our measurement is in agreement with those by 
Strausbaugh & Cucchiara (GCN 31214) and de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN 
31218), taken at a comparable epoch. Compared to the magnitudes reported 
by Zheng & Filippenko (GCN 31203), Ito et al. (GCN 31217) and Jang (GCN 
31213), our data confirm the unusually slow decay,

We report for the afterglow the following coordinates (0.3"" uncertainty):

RA = 14:09:10.12
Dec = +27:53:18.1

A bright, extended object (r ~ 19.5) is visible about 5.5"" to the N-E of 
the afterglow (as already pointed out by Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 31203), 
which is also visible in the SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and Legacy surveys.

A spectrum was secured covering both the afterglow and the nearby galaxy 
(wavelength range 3700-9400 AA). A weak emission line is detected on top 
of the host galaxy trace at 7063 AA, which could be due to Halpha at z = 
0.076. This is marginally consistent with the SDSS photometric redshift 
0.140 +- 0.0375, unlike other interpretations of the same line.

No clear absorption or emission features are detected in the afterglow 
trace. This may be due to the modest S/N, and is also consistent with a 
low redshift, as is the detection of the afterglow in all the UVOT UV 
filters (Swift observation ID 1088940000).

It is not clear at the present stage whether the afterglow is physically 
associated with the galaxy at z = 0.076. While the sky proximity and the 
low redshift are indeed suggestive, the physical offset at z = 0.076 
would be about 8 kpc (in projection), an unusually large value for long 
GRBs. There is also no visible emission in the archival images down to r 
~ 24 (AB) at the location of the afterglow, which would be unusual for a 
long GRB at z = 0.076.

Moreover, if placed at z = 0.076, GRB 211211A would be an outlier of the 
the Amati relation (e.g. Nava et al. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 1256), with E_iso 
= 1.4*10^54 erg and E_peak ~ 700 keV (using the Fermi/GBM prompt 
properties from Mangan et al., GCN 31210).

Overall, a moderate-redshift GRB (with z > 0.076) is consistent with the 
available information. The detection of an emerging supernova could 
clarify the situation. We encourage further photometric and 
spectroscopic follow-up of this potentially interesting event.",0.076,GRB 211211A,Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT),Spectroscopic,0.076

etal., GCN 30380; Ridnaia et al., GCN 30388) using publicly available 
data of GBM/Fermi. The burst consists of several episodes of emission 
with duration of T_90 = 4.6 s, but the emission is visible up to 20 s 
after the trigger. Energy spectrum constructed in the time interval of 
(-0.2, 6.5) seconds relative to the GBM trigger time is best described 
by Bandmodel with relatively low E_peak = 294 keV corroborating with 
E_peak reported by GBM team (Malacaria et al., GCN 30380) and Konus-Wind 
(Ridnaia et al., GCN 30388).

Based on E_peak, Fluence in 1 keV  10 MeV range (2.77e-5 erg cm^-2) and 
T_90 we draw a trajectory of the burst in EH - T_90 diagram varying the 
unknown source redshift 
(http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB210704A/GRB210704A_EH-T90_GBM.png , see [1-2] for 
details). The lower 2 sigma redshift limit of the source is z=0.11, 
which excludes the association of the GRB with the field galaxy at z = 
0.0817, but leaves a possibility of association with the field cluster 
at z = 0.203 (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 30392). We also estimate 
E_iso = 8.2e50 erg at z = 0.11 and E_iso = 3.7e53 erg at z = 2.34 
(marginally suggested after GTC spectroscopy, de Ugarte Postigo et al.,

The observation started at 2:27 UT (2.45 hr after the burst) and consisted of 3x600 s with grism R1000B, covering the spectral range between 3700 and 7800 AA.

In a preliminary reduction with old calibrations we detect a strong continuum with a plethora of absorption features superposed to it. We identify features that include SiII, SiIV, OI, CI, CII, CIV, FeII, AlII, AlIII, NiII, CrII ZnII, as well as fine structure lines of SiII, FeII, NiII at a common redshift of 1.937, which we identify as the redshift of the GRB. We also detect an intervening system with MgII and MgI at z=1.095.

Additionally, the flux calibrated spectrum shows a strong broad absorption feature at ~4500AA, resembling a dust bump. This could be consistent with a 2175 AA dust feature due to the intervening absorber.

We note that at a redshift of 1.937, the initial prompt emission spike is extremely luminous, and we expect the afterglow to be among the most luminous prompt flashes ever detected. Using the fluence reported on the automatic Swift/BAT analysis page in the 15-350 keV band, we derive an E_iso ~ 1.7e54 erg, without any k-correction.

The spectrum shows a very strong continuum with very weak superposed lines. We detect lines corresponding to FeII, MgII and MgI at a common redshift of z = 1.1345, in agreement with the measurement from the NOT (Fynbo et al. GCN 30182). Additionally, the high SNR allows us to detect a weak intervening system through the identification of MgII at a redshift of z = 0.557. Although the redshift 1.1345 is, strictly speaking, a lower limit, the lack of any further features at higher redshift, especially considering the high SNR of the spectrum, allows us to consider this as the redshift of the GRB.

We note that the features detected at the redshift of the GRB are very weak. We can compare their strength to a sample of long GRB afterglow features using the line strength parameter, following the method of de Ugarte Postigo et al. (2012, A&A 548, A11).

We observed the fast optical transient ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv (Kool et al.,
GCN 29405), likely associated with the Fermi, GECAM, and IPN GRB 210204A
(The Fermi GBM team, GCN 29390; F. Kunzweiler et al., GCN 29391; Li et al.,
GCN 29392; Hurley et al., GCN 29408) using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal)
equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Spectroscopic observations
started at 01:38 UT on 06 February 2021, i.e. ~1.8 days after the burst
detection and they consisted of 4 x 600 s exposures. In the resulting
spectrum, we find a series of strong absorption lines that we identify as
Mg II, Si IV, C IV, and Ca II at a common redshift of 1.466. At this
redshift, we also detect emission lines of [O II], [O III] and H-alpha
Balmer line. We therefore conclude that z = 1.466 is the redshift of
ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv.

The measured redshift implies a high intrinsic brightness (absolute
magnitude ~ 28 at an epoch of 45 min after the GRB; Kool et al., GCN
29405), which is typical of long GRB afterglows. This, coupled with the
observed absorption lines set, typical of long GRB environments, further
strengthens the association between ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv and GRB 210204A.

We observed the field of GRB 201221A (Page et al., GCN 29096) using the 
ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph.

Using the acquisition camera, multi-band imaging was secured. Within the 
XRT error circle (Evans, GCN 29097), no source is detected in an r-band 
image (taken at mean epoch of 42 min after the GRB) down to limiting 
magnitude r > 23.5 (AB). However, a source is clearly visible in the 
z-band image with z = 19.76 +- 0.04 AB (mean time 35 min after the GRB). 
The corresponding color r-z > 3.7 is exceptionally red. The coordinates 
of the object are (J2000, 0.3"" error):

RA = 14:17:55.26
Dec = -45:24:58.0

Spectroscopy of the z-band source was executed covering the wavelength 
range 3000-25000 AA. Unfortunately due to visibility constraints, only 
two spectra by 600 s each were secured, plus two extra exposures during 
twilight which have lower quality. We report on the analysis of the 
first set only, which has a mean time of 1.65 hr after the GRB.

Continuum is well detected in the infrared arm, as well as in the red 
part of the visible arm. A clear break is detected around 8150 AA, 
which, if interpreted as the Lyman break, corresponds to z = 5.70. Weak 
continuum is detected blueward of the break, until it vanishes 
completely at the corresponding location of the Lyman limit. We thus 
conclude that z = 5.70 is the redshift of GRB 201221A.

Observations started at 00:50:50 UT on December 2 (i.e., 22.16 hr after

In the spectrum, the continuum is detected at excellent signal-to-noise 
but is largely featureless. From a non-detection of any break in the 
continuum down to 3500 , we derive a redshift upper limit of z < 1.88. 
There are no strong lines visible, but we note the possible presence of 
three weak lines, which, if real, can be identified as the Mg II doublet

s spectra on 2018 July 29 beginning at 05:10 UT.  The spectra cover a
wavelength range from 3000-25000 AA.

A red continuum is detected across the spectral range. We detect
absorption features due to Mg II (3124,3132), Mg I (3187), and Ca II
(4395,4434) at a consistent redshift of z=0.117, which we propose as the
redshift of the GRB.  Galactic ISM absorption features of Ca II and Na I
are also detected.

This GRB resembles the famous GRB 030329, but slightly less energetic
(E_iso = 2e+51 erg given the fluence value provided by Veres et al., GCN
23053).  It is the closest energetic (E_iso > 1e+51 erg) GRB with a
measured redshift to date.

We note that although Galactic extinction in this direction is
significant (A_V = 0.763; Schlafly et al. 2011, ApJ 737:103) a campaign
to study the anticipated associated supernova should still be practical
with moderate-aperture telescopes at this redshift.

We observed the field of GRB 180624A (Swift trigger 844192; Gibson et 
al., GCN 22832) with the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) 
instrument mounted on the 2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt Graham, AZ, USA). 
Images were obtained starting at 10:15 UT on 2018-06-25, 20.5 hr after 
the  GRB trigger.

Inspection of the 60 s acquisition image reveals a point source within 
the Swift/XRT enhanced error circle (Evans et al., GCN 22835), at 
coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 21:12:23.378
Dec(J2000)= -02:20:17.30

with an uncertainty of 0.2"" in each coordinate, which is consistent with 
the source reported by Guidorzi et al. (GCN 22839). The source has 
magnitude r' = 20.6 +- 0.1 (AB), calibrated against r'-band SDSS field 
stars, and it is not visible in Pan-STARRS images, thus clearly singling 
it out as the afterglow.

Spectroscopy of the source was obtained for a total of 2x600 s, covering 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA. A broad trough is well visible 
centered around 4700 AA, which we identify as a DLA feature at z ~ 2.86. 
Detection of several absorption features, which we interpret as due to, 
among others, Si II, C IV, Al II, Al III, Fe II, allows to precisely 
measure the redshift to be z = 2.855, which we consider to be the 
redshift of GRB 180624A.

We also note the presence of a close-by and fainter galaxy, which is 
also visible in the Pan-STARRS images, 2.5"" NW of the afterglow, at 
position:
RA(J2000) = 21:12:23.244
Dec(J2000)= -02:20:15.76
possibly consistent with the extended source reported by Schady (GCN 
22840). Given the measured redshift, we do not consider this object as 
related to the GRB, as it would have an unreasonable brightness and 
large separation at z = 2.8.

No correction for the expected Galactic foreground extinction, 
corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.05 mag in the direction of 
the burst (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011), has been applied.

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 180325A (Troja et al. GCN 22532) with the ESO VLT/X-shooter spectrograph, covering the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA. Spectroscopy started at 03:20:45 UT on 2018-03-25 (i.e., ~1.5 hr after the GRB) and consisted of 8 exposures of 600 s.

The spectrum exhibits a red continuum with several absorption features, including Ly-alpha and different metal and fine-structure lines, together with [OII], [OIII] and Halpha emission lines, all at a common redshift of z=2.248. At the same redshift, we also note the presence of a clear continuum depression corresponding to the 2175 AA bump. Finally, the spectrum shows the presence of a strong double intervening system at z = 2.041/2.043. 

The above results are in agreement with the findings of Heintz et al. (GCN 22535).

Schmidl (TLS), on behalf of the STARGATE collaboration, report:

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 171010A (Omodei et al., GCN 21985; Poolakkil & Meegan, GCN 21992; Sharma et al., GCN 21990) at z = 0.33 (Kankare et al., GCN 22002) using the ESO Very Large Telescope. Imaging was secured on 2017 Oct 31.25 UT (20.45 days after the GRB) using the VIMOS instrument, in the R and I filters, for a total of 10 min exposure each.

Both the candidate host galaxy of the GRB (Thorstensen & Halpern, GCN 21897; Izzo & Malesani, GCN 21988) and a second compact source, at a location consistent with that of the optical afterglow, are well visible in our images. The spatial coincidence of the second source could indicate late-time emission associated with the GRB, or the presence of an underlying star-forming region.

Spectroscopy covering both the host nucleus and the afterglow location was carried out on 2017 Nov 1.25 UT (21.46 days after the GRB; 16 days in the GRB rest frame), using the X-shooter spectrograph, for a total exposure time of 4x1200 s. The traces of both objects are visible, showing a wealth of narrow nebular emission lines, some of which especially intense at the afterglow location. We measure for the galaxy nucleus a redshift z = 0.3285, consistent with the report by Kankare et al. (GCN 22002).

Faint continuum emission is detected at the GRB location. This could be due to an associated SN, as expected for long GRBs at this redshift, or to an underlying star forming region, or a combination of both. The spectral shape is curved and redder than at the nucleus location, but extinction is low as inferred from the Balmer decrement. This opens the possibility of excess light from the SN. In the attempt to isolate its contribution, we then estimated the host contamination by rescaling the nucleus spectrum assuming it contributes the entire flux at 3500 AA (rest frame), where GRB-associated SNe have negligible emission (e.g. Hjorth et al. 2003, Nature, 423, 847; Mazzali et al. 2003, ApJ, 599, 95), due to metal line blanketing.

By comparing the residual contribution with known SN/GRB templates, we find a good resemblance with other GRB-associated SNe, such as SN 1998bw (at 6 days post maximum; e.g. Patat et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 900) and SN 2006aj (at 5 days post maximum; e.g. Pian et al., Nature, 442, 1011). Based on this resemblance, the object has been assigned the IAU name of SN 2017htp. The brightness of the SN is about 30% (1.3 mag fainter) than SN 1998bw at a comparable epoch. An accurate computation requires however a more rigorous host subtraction which will be possible with late-time templates.

""Further analysis of the VLT spectra of the afterglow of GRB 030429 
(GCN 2184) and the neighbor galaxy at a separation of 1.2 arcsec from the 
afterglow (GCN 2185, 2196) has led to the following conclusions. Based on 
absorption lines due to HI, OI, SiII, and CII we infer a redshift of 
z=2.6564+/-0.0008 for GRB 030429. Based on a single, weak emission line in 
the spectrum of the neighbor galaxy, which we interpret as [OII], and weak 
Calcium H and K absorption we infer a redshift of z=0.841+/-0.001 for the 
galaxy. This is consistent with the redshift of an absorption line in the 
spectrum of the afterglow if interpreted as MgII. This galaxy is therefore 
not the host galaxy of the GRB. In deep images obtained with the VLT/FORS2 
on May 5 the afterglow is only barely detected. We do not find any evidence 
for a host galaxy at the position of the afterglow to R>25. The separation 
between the position of the afterglow and the z=0.841 neighbor galaxy of 1.2 
arcsec is comparable to the Einstein radius for a massive galaxy at that 
redshift. Gravitational lensing could therefore affect the appearance of 
GRB 030429.

  7416.97   2852.97   1.6005   Mg I 

The mean redshift is 1.6004 +- 0.0005 (random) +- 0.0005 (systematic).
This agrees to within the quoted error with the new determination of
the absorber redshift by Hjorth et al. (GCN 249).

We note the remarkably small velocity dispersion implied by these data,
less than about 60 km/s in the restframe, suggesting that the lines arise 
from a single subgalactic-size cloud (which of course may be a part of the 
host galaxy's ISM), rather than from an ansamble of clouds moving within 
the potential well of a normal, massive galaxy.  It is also possible that 
the GRB host is a dwarf galaxy, in which case the object detected near the 
line of sight both in the K band (Djorgovski et al., GCN 243) and in the 
R band (Yadigaroglu and Halpern, GCN 248) may be a foreground galaxy.

No other convincing absorption systems, and no emission lines are detected
in these data, in the useful wavelength range of approximately 4700 to 9000
Angstroms.  We do not detect Ca II H+K absorption, nor any other common
absorption lines, e.g., Na D, nor any common emission lines (e.g., [O II] 
3727, H alpha, H beta, etc.) from either of the two absorption systems 
originally proposed by Hjorth et al. (GCN 219).

We have also measured the redshift of the galaxy approximately 10 arcsec
west of the OT.  From 4 relatively ""clean"" lines, Ca II H+K, H beta, and
H alpha, we derive for its redshift z = 0.2783 +- 0.0005.  From 4 blended
lines, CH G-band 4300, Mg I 5173+5184, Fe I + Ca I 5267, and Na D 5893,
we derive z = 0.278 +- 0.001, again in an excellent agreement with Hjorth
et al. (GCN 249).  No absorption or emission lines corresponding to this 
redshift are seen in the spectrum of the OT.

Observation consisted in 3x900s exposures using the R1000B 
grism, covering the range between 3700 and 7880 AA. The mean 
epoch of the combined spectrum is 03:09:29 UT (5.12 hr after the 
GRB onset). Additionally, g, r, i, and z-band observations were 
obtained. We note that the coordinates of the afterglow are 
19:07:32.09, -16:25:05.8 (J2000 +/-0.5), which places the GRB 
approximately 5 away from those of the source identified by 
Lipunov et al. (GCN 21173) and Pozanenko et al. (GCN 21174). 
The afterglow can be also detected in the early Swift/UVOT

consisted of two exposures of 15 min each the second obtained at 2.75hh

A preliminary analysis of the spectra reveals no strong absorption
features. A more detailed analysis is needed to search for faint
absorption lines.  A faint emission line at 5846 Angstrom (see Martini

emission was less strong. If this is [OII] emission from the host
galaxy, then the redshift is z=0.568.

transient (Peterson & Price, GCN 1985) of GRB 030329 (Vanderspek et
al., GCN #1997) using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE)
Camera on the Baade 6.5 m at the Las Campanas Observatory.  The
dispersion at 7600 Angstrom (Ang) is 0.053 Ang/pixel. The narrow
emission lines (Martini et al., GCN #2013; Della Ceca et al., GCN
#2015; Greiner et al. #2020; Caldwell et al., GCN #2053; Eracleous et
al., GCN #2117), presumably from the host galaxy, are well detected in
each 1800 sec exposure.  Using a fit to the H-alpha line, we find the
heliocentric systemic redshift of the host galaxy is:

         z = 0.168541 +/- 0.000004

(statistical error). This is most precise emission line redshift of a
GRB host galaxy reported to date. This redshift is consistent with the
host redshift reported previously (Greiner et al., GCN #2020;
Eracleous et al., GCN #2117; Caldwell et al., GCN #2053).

The emission lines are resolved in the dispersion direction with a
FWHM (H-alpha) of 1.44 +/- 0.02 Ang (56.1 km/s). While the core of the
emission lines can be fit by a Gaussian, extended wings of emission
and similar velocity substructure within the profiles are apparent. In
particular, we identify a faint emission structure that is ~66 km/s to
the red of the central core. The host plus OT continuum is discernible
in each echelle order redward of ~7000 Ang.

In ~0.4 arcsecond seeing the emission from the host plus OT is still
unresolved in the spatial direction. The compactness, the relatively
low mass implied by the velocity structure of the emission lines, and
the faintness of the host (Blake & Bloom; GCN #2011) all continue to
support the notion of the host of GRB 030329 as an intrinsically
underluminous galaxy (Eracleous et al., GCN #2117). Despite the low
overall star formation rate of the host (Caldwell et al., GCN #2053),
given the high equivalent widths of the detected lines, the

report:

We observed the field of GRB 160623A (Vianello et al., GCN 19553; 
Frederiks et al., GCN 19554; Mailyan et al., GCN 19555) with the Nordic 
Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the AlFOSC imager. Our 
observations had a mid time 2016 July 8.09 UT (14.88 days after the GRB 
trigger) and consisted of 6x300 s in the SDSS i filter.

Close to the position of the optical and X-ray afterglow (Mingo et al., 
GCN 19558; Pozanenko et al., GCN 19561; Butler et al., GCN 19567), we 
detect a bright source at the following coordinates (J2000):

RA = 21:01:11.65
Dec = +42:13:15.0

We measure I = 20.6 +- 0.2 (Vega) against several nearby USNO stars 
(error dominated by the calibration). To determine the relation of this 
object with the GRB afterglow, we cross-registered our image with those 
from RATIR (Butler et al., GCN 19567), yielding an RMS of 0.02"". We find 
that the NOT source is offset to the SE of the afterglow by 0.7"". This 
source could thus be the host galaxy or an unrelated, foreground star. 
We also note some faint emission in the RATIR image at the NOT 
coordinates, despite being blended with the brighter afterglow.

A picture showing the comparison of the two images is shown here:

http://www.astro.ku.dk/~malesani/GRB/160623A/GRB160623A_NOT_RATIR.png

A spectrum (3x1200 s exposure) was acquired using the Gran Telescopio 
Canarias (GTC) equipped with OSIRIS, covering the wavelength range 
5100-10,000 AA (grism R1000R), starting on 2016 July 10.163 UT (16.95 
days after the GRB). The slit was centered at the coordinates of the NOT 
object, but also partially overlapped with the afterglow location.

We detect continuum over the whole wavelength range and two emission 
lines in the red part of the spectrum, which we interpret as Halpha and 
[N II] at a common redshift z = 0.367. At the same redshift we also 
detect weak [O III] 5008 (dimmed by the large foreground extinction). 
This is most likely the redshift of GRB 160623A.

The source detected in the NOT image is possibly a foreground star (the 
Galactic latitude is b = -2.7 deg). In the GTC acquisition image, the 
object is pointlike with a seeing of 1.2"". On the other hand, inspecting 
the 2D spectrum, the spatial profile of the emission lines is different 
from that of the continuum: the features are wider and elongated towards 
the position of the afterglow. A compact host cannot however be excluded.

At z = 0.367, a SN as bright as SN 1998bw would only reach a peak 
magnitude of I ~ 24.8 (Vega) given the large Galactic extinction (A_I = 
2.2 mag; Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). From ground, such a SN would be 
difficult to distinguish against the brighter foreground object.

particular Roi Alonso and Diego Hidalgo) and at the GTC.",0.367,GRB 160623A,GTC,Spectroscopic,0.367

started on 2016 June 27.19 UT (1.25 days after the Fermi trigger) and 
consisted of 4 spectra by 600 s each, covering the wavelength range 
3500-20000 AA.

The afterglow is well detected in the acquisition image with R ~ 19.1 +- 
0.3, where the large error is due to scatter in the USNO magnitudes used 
as reference, and the r versus R filter transformation.

The continuum trace is well detected in our exposures, down to ~3100 AA. 
The lack of any drop sets an upper limit to the redshift z < 1.55. A 
number of superimposed absorption features are visible; among others, we 
detect Mg I, Mg II, Fe II, C IV, Si IV, O I, Si II, Zn II, Al II, and Al 
III, all at a common redshift z = 1.406, which we conclude to be the 
redshift of GRB 160625B. We also detect an intervening Mg II absorption 
system at z = 1.319.

At z = 1.406, the fluence in the 10-1000 keV Fermi band (Burns, GCN 
19587) corresponds to an isotropic-equivalent energy of ~2.5*10^54 erg.

beginning at 08:00 UT on Feb 26, which provides a high-resolution
(R~5,000) spectrum with high S/N.  In a preliminary analysis of the
data, we identify three absorption systems at z=1.984, z=1.961, and
z=1.043.  The two higher-redshift systems have been reported
independently by Greiner et al. (GCN 1886), expanding on the initial
reports of Ando et al. (GCN 1884).

For the higher-redshift systems we detect Mg II 2795,2803; Al II 1671;
Al III 1863; Si II 1527; Si IV 1394 and 1403; C IV 1548,1551; and
various Mn II and Fe II lines.  For the z=1.043 system, we detect Mg
II 2795,2803, and possibly some Fe II lines.

The two higher-redshift systems exhibit very strong equivalent widths,
whereas the equivalent widths for the z=1.043 system are much weaker,
consistent with the population of field galaxy QSO absorbers.
Moreover, each of the higher-redshift systems, separated by 2300 km/s
in the rest frame, consists of multiple components with further
velocity substructure at the <100 km/s level.

Swift BAT triggered on the early activity of GRB 151027A (Maselli et

trigger observing the main event. By using the Swift/XRT spectrum
repository at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/ (see Evans et al.
2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177) we selected a time interval with an almost
constant hardness ratio, starting at 150 s after the burst onset
and lasting 281 s. We then fit the Window Timing (WT) spectrum with
XSPEC using the model tbabs*ztbabs*pow.
We assume a Galactic column density of 3.75x10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et
al. 2013, MNRAS, 431, 394) and we allow for a 30% uncertainty in the fit.
We fit the spectrum using C-statistics (C-stat=593.74 with 637 d.o.f.).
In the intrinsic column density vs. redshift plane there is just one 
deep minimum
hinting for a redshift z=0.38+/-0.17 (90% confidence level) and an
intrinsic column density N_H(z)=(3.6+/-0.7)x10^21 cm^-2.

detect the absorption lines due to Mg I, Mg II, and Fe II associated

also detect the unidentified absorption lines at 463, 466, 510, and
514.5 nm reported in GCN 1579, as well as the narrow emission line at
405 nm and the absorption lines between 400 and 404 nm (GCN 1599).

We identify the emission line as Lyman-alpha at z=2.323, in
contradiction to the identification as C IV in GCN 1599.  We note that
P-Cygni absorption line profiles from a hypothetical starburst host
galaxy should not be prominent above the bright continuum of the
transient.  In addition, we feel that a lone UV emission line is
significantly more likely to be Lyman-alpha than C IV.  The
previously unidentified absorption lines can now be identified as the
Si IV 1393.8, 1402.8 Angstrom doublet and C IV 1548.2, 1550.8
Angstrom doublet.  These absorption lines have multiple velocity
components, as does the Lyman-alpha absorption.  We note the
wavelength coincidence of one of the components of Lyman-alpha with
the expected C IV absorption from the Mg II system at z=1.603, but
believe it only to be a coincidence.

An additional point in favor of the z=2.323 interpretation is the
appearance of the continuum to the blue of the Lyman-alpha line.
While there is no substantial Lyman break, there are many more
absorption lines blueward of Lyman-alpha than redward.  A previously
unnoted absorption feature with multiple components is present at
341 nm, consistent with Lyman-beta at this redshift.

""Starting on October 05 2002 01:37 UT we have obtained high resolution
spectra (R=50,000, 6 km/s in the observer frame) of the optical
afterglow of GRB021004 (Fox et al., GCN #1564) using UVES at VLT.  The
observations cover the full spectral range 3200-9800 Angstrom, in good
seeing conditions. At the time of the observations the afterglow
magnitude was R~18.6 and B~19.0.

A preliminary analysis of the first hour of observation reveals
several absorption lines associated with at least 4 metal systems
(also see Salamanca et al., GCN #1611).

The z=2.321,2.327 system is probably very close to the GRB itself or
the circumburst medium. C IV absorption lines associated with this
system are in fact extremely strong and complex, spanning a velocity
range of about 1000 km/s. This system may show the so called ""line
locking"", possibly relativistic, effect, where the second component of
the z=2.321 C IV doublet is ""locked"" to the first component of the
z=2.327 C IV doublet. This effect has been observed in the past in
narrow absorption systems associated with high redshift quasars (e.g.
Wampler 1991, ApJ, 368, 40) and O stars (Lucy & Solomon, 1970, ApJ,
159, 879).

Low ionization lines of AlII1670 and possibly SiII1526 are also
detected in the red wing of the z=2.327 component. Low ionization
lines are not detected in the lower redshift system at z=2.321.

The z=2.2958,2.2985 system is shifted by ~2500 km/s blueward of the
strong z=2.321,2.327 system and shows much weaker, but still very
strong, C IV lines and no low ionization lines. The velocity range of
this absorption is of about 300 km/s.

The z=1.6019 intervening system shows a narrow Al III absorption with
column density of log N(AlIII)=13.2 +\- 0.1 and Doppler parameter b=12
+\- 1 km/s.

The other system at z=1.38 shows a complex structure with at least 4
components spanning a velocity range of about 200 km/s.  The FeII
column densities suggest that this system may be associated with a

exposures with the R400 grating and 1 arcsec slit, commencing at June
19.3 UTC.  In each image we identify a single emission line at 7388A
superposed on a continuum emission with no apparent absorption
features.  If this line is due to [O II], the redshift is z = 0.98. 
However, there is a hint of a line at 5634A which suggests that the line
is actually due to Halpha at z = 0.13.

In addition to the bright emission line due to the GRB host galaxy,
there is a brighter emission line at the same wavelength from the galaxy
17 arcsec North of the GRB.  A spectrum from the Magellan telescope
reveals the presence of the [N II] doublet flanking the Halpha line for
this galaxy, with a secure redshift of z = 0.125.  Based on the
identical wavelength of the lines, the two galaxies are likely related,

Xu (DARK/NBI), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), S. Geier (NOT, DARK/NBI), Z. Cano(U. Iceland), P. Jakobsson (U. Iceland) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 130702A (Singer et al., GCN 14967; Cheung et al., GCN 14971; Collazzi et al., GCN 14972) with the Nordic Opitcal Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC. In addition to our photometric observations (reported in Schulze et al., GCN 14978), we obtained an optical spectrum, with a total exposure of 2 x 1800 s, using Grism #4 and covering the wavelength range 3750 - 9000 AA at a resolution of 17 AA.

The slit was oriented to cover both the transient source (also dubbed iPTF13bxl) that has been suggested to be the afterglow of GRB 130702A, and the bright SDSS galaxy located 7.6"" South of the source (SDSS J142914.57+154619.3; Singer et al., GCN 14967). 

The galaxy is found to be at z = 0.145, based on Ca II H & K absorption and emission by [OII] and Halpha. The emission features are weak and we do not detect Hbeta or [OIII]. Overall, and combined with the SDSS colors, this galaxy shows very weak star formation activity. 

This redshift is consistent with the redshift of the transient source reported by Mulchaey et al. (ATel 5191) and the description given there. The trace of our NOT spectrum at the location of the transient is mostly featureless and we cannot detect the emission lines reported by Mulchaey et al., probably due to a lower S/N.

The common redshift suggests that the transient source iPTF13bxl is associated with the galaxy SDSS J142914.57+154619.3. If this transient is indeed the afterglow of GRB 130702A at z = 0.145, it implies an E_iso = (3.0 +- 1.0) * 10^50 erg in the 10-1000 keV (Collazzi et al., GCN 14972).

We note that this is an unusual environment for a long GRB: located at a large offset (19.1 kpc in projection) from a relatively passive galaxy. However, we cannot exclude that more sources in the field, including the fainter (r ~ 23 mag) object at 0.6"" from the transient (SDSS J142914.75+154626.0; Singer et al., GCN 14967) might be at the same redshift. A possible confirmation of the GRB nature of this transient will be the emergence of an associated supernova. At z = 0.145, a supernova similar to SN 1998bw will peak at R ~ 19.8 mag about 20 days after the GRB, and will be easily detectable.",0.145,GRB 130702A,Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT),Spectroscopic,0.145

S. G. Djorgovski, S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech), R. Goodrich (WMKO), 
D. A. Frail (NRAO), and J. S. Bloom (Caltech), report on behalf 
of the Caltech GRB collaboration:

Analysis of the spectra of the proposed optical/radio counterpart of 
GRB 980703 (see GCN Circ. 128, 136, 137) gives the following results:

The strong emission line is definitively identified as [O II] 3727 at
the redshift z_em = 0.9660 +- 0.0002.  It has the equivalent width of
90 +- 2 Angstroms (observed), or 45.7 +- 1 A in the restframe.  This
is somewhit higher than typical for galaxies at comparable redshifts
and magnitudes.  After correcting for the as-yet unknown contribution
of the GRB afterglow to the continuum flux, these numbers will be higher.
The observed line flux is 2.7e-16 erg/cm2/s.

There are several absorption features identified as Fe II (2344, 2374,
2383, 2587, and 2600 A) and Mg II (2796 and 2803) lines, with the mean
redshift z_abs = 0.9653 +- 0.0007, superposed on an otherwise featureless
UV continuum.  This too is typical of actively star-forming galaxies at
similar redshifts.  We also see the 4000-Angstrom break.

The observed spectrophotometric magnitude at the epoch of these 
observations (July 7.6 UT) are:  B = 23.3, V = 22.65, and R = 21.9 mag, 
with the zero-point uncertain by a few tenths of a magnitude, due to the
unknown slit losses.  The UV continuum blueward of the [O II] line can
be described with a power-law F_nu ~ nu**alpha, with alpha = -1.5 +- 0.2,
possibly indicative of a modest extinction.

Assuming a Friedmann cosmology with H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_0 = 0.2, and
Lambda_0 = 0, the luminosity distance at this redshift is 1.9208e28 cm.
Our observed [O II] line flux then translates to the restframe line
luminosity of 1.25e42 erg/s.  Assuming the conversion from Kennicutt
(1992), the implied star formation rate is about 63 M_sun/yr, even 
without any extinction or slit-loss corrections.

We thus conclude that the host galaxy of GRB 980703 is a compact starburst
object.  This gives some support to the models which associate origins of
GRBs with massive star formation.

Further observations of the object are in progress.

the UVB, VIS, and NIR arms, covering the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA. 
The slit was aligned so to cover both the galaxy at z = 0.28 present in 
the SDSS (Cucchiara et al., GCN 13245; Tanvir et al., GCN 13251) and the 
GRB optical counterpart (Cucchiara et al., GCN 13245).

We detect a plethora of nebular emission lines from the candidate host 
galaxy, including [O II], [O III], Balmer lines up to Hzeta, [N II], [S 
II], at a common redshift z = 0.283, thus confirming the results of 
Tanvir et al. (GCN 13251).

The trace of the GRB counterpart is rather blue (see also Nardini et 
al., GCN 13256), and we detect Mg II at z = 0.283 in absorption. No 
further absorption features are visible. We also note that the spatial 
extent of the brightest emission lines from the SDSS galaxy encompasses 
the position of the GRB counterpart, indicating nebular emission at z = 
0.283 at the GRB position.

While a chance superposition cannot be excluded, we note that the lack 
of absorption features at z > 0.283 would require a very tenuous 
environment at the GRB location. Furthermore, the UVOT detection in all 
the UV filters (Kuin & Troja, GCN 13248) implies a low redshift z <~ 
1.3. Last, we note that the UVOT photometry at t ~ 5 ks after the burst 
reveals a very blue spectrum, which is not typical of GRB afterglows, 
but is reminiscent of the very blue early emission of GRB 060218 
(Campana et al. 2006, Nature, 442, 1008). We thus conclude that the GRB 
is also likely at z = 0.283.

Using the gamma-ray fluence reported by Barthelmy et al. (GCN 13246), at 
z = 0.283 the isotropic-equivalent energy release of GRB 120422A is 
~4.4*10^49 erg, which is typical of local GRBs, often associated with 
supernovae. We encourage photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to 
detect the emergence of a supernova, or lack thereof.

We performed 2x900s spectroscopic observations of the

The spectrum reveals several absorption features, including 
FeII2586,2600, MgII2796,2803 at a common redshift of 1.633.

Observations started around 05:03 UT on 2012-03-27, which is roughly 2.13 hrs after the trigger. Four exposures in a nodding pattern with an integration time of 600 s each were obtained. The spectrum covers an approximate wavelength range between 3100 and 23000 AA. The slit width was set to 1"" in the ultra-violet/blue arm, and 0.9"" in the visual and near-infrared arm, resulting in a resolving power range of approximately 4500-7500.

Preliminary reduction of the spectrum shows a well detected continuum with several absorption features, that we identify with Ly-limit and Ly-alpha as well as absorption lines of CII/CII*, SiII/SiII*, AlI, FeII and MgII at a redshift of 2.813. This is confirms previous reports based on spectroscopy (Perley & Tanvir, GCN #13133) and photometry (Sudilovsky et al. GCN #13129).

""We report optical spectroscopy of the type Ic SN 2001em (Papenkova et al.,
IAUC 7722, Filippenko & Chornock, IAUC 7737) in UGC 11794 (d=84 Mpc).
This supernova was recently shown to have a rising radio luminosity (Stockdale
et al., IAUC 8282) and bright X-ray emission (Pooley & Lewin, IAUC 8323),
both of which are atypical for a type Ic supernova at t > 2 years. An off-axis
GRB jet was proposed as an explanation for this behavior (Granot &
Ramirez-Ruiz, astro-ph/0403421).

The optical spectrum is highly unusual for a type Ic SN, and is dominated by
a broad (FWHM of 40 angstrom = 1800 km/s) H-alpha emission line. The strong
nebular features of oxygen and calcium, characteristic of old (>1 year)
SNe Ic, including SN 1998bw and SN 2002ap (e.g., Foley et al. 2003,
PASP, 115, 1220), are not detected.
The spectrum is suggestive of strong interaction with the circumstellar medium
and is similar in shape to spectra of strongly interacting type IIn
SNe at a similar age (e.g., SN 1998S, Pozzo et al. 2004, astro-ph/0404533).

This interpretation is consistent with the report by Pooley & Lewin
that the X-ray emission can be well fit with a thermal bremsstrahlung
model.  A dense circumstellar medium would also explain the bright
radio emission, as was proposed by Soderberg, Frail & Wieringa (2004,
ApJ, 607, L13).

Observations started 2009-11-20 00:42, 10.8 days after the trigger and

the 1st epoch (Afonso et al., GCN #10158), the last imaging clearly
shows a fading of more than 1.5 magnitudes. The 1st epoch was hence
dominated by afterglow light, favoring a redshift of around z = 3.5 +/-
0.4.

wavelength range from approximately 3500 - 10000 A.

At the location of the candidate host galaxy, we detect a strongly red
continuum consistent with the published photometry (Leloudas et al., GCN
10387).  We detect strong, clearly resolved emission lines from H-alpha
and [NII] at a redshift of z = 0.41.  No other obvious lines are visible
over spectral range in our preliminary reduction.  The lack of H-beta,
coupled with the red spectrum and colors, suggest a relatively dusty
environment.  At this redshift, the projected offset of ~ 6.8"" from the
candidate afterglow corresponds to a distance of ~ 35 kpc.

No obvious trace is visible at the location of the afterglow.

to include both the pre-existing object and the candidate afterglow. 
Observations started on 2010 Feb 20.105 UT (0.47 days after the GRB), 
for a total exposure time of 4x1200 s.

In a preliminary analysis of the spectra, we detect a clear signal from 
both objects. The continuum from the candidate afterglow is only 
detected redward of ~5310 AA. A further spectral break is recognised at 
~7060 AA. This is consistent with the onset of the Lyman limits and of 
the Lyman alpha forest at a common redshift z = 4.8. Our observations 
are consistent with the photometric redshift indicated by the GROND 
observations (Kruehler et al., GCN 10439).

The high luminosity of the object and its spectral shape indicate that 
this is indeed the afterglow of GRB 100219A.

The spectrum of the nearby galaxy implies a significantly lower 
redshift, around z=0.25, hence it is unrelated to the GRB.

Spectrograph mounted on the 8-m Gemini South telescope.  Our first
sequence of 2 x 900 s observations started at 2:44 UT on 20 February
2010 and cover the range from 6500 - 9500 A.  Only the proposed host
galaxy was contained on the slit for these spectra.  Our second set,
starting immediately afterward, cover the wavelength range from 4500 -
7500 A and both the proposed host and afterglow are positioned on the
slit.

From the nearby galaxy, we detect strong emissions features corresponding
to H-alpha, H-beta, and [O III] at a common redshift of z = 0.217.

The spectrum of the afterglow shows a strong break at ~ 6880 A, with
only faint continuum blueward of this feature.  Interpreting this as
the Lyman-alpha break, this correponds to a redshift of z ~ 4.7.  We
find marginal evidence for narrow absorption features corresponding to Si
II and Si II* at z = 4.65 redward of the break - however the relatively
low signal-to-noise ratio of our spectrum in this regime makes this result
somewhat uncertain.

Our derived redshifts for both objects are similar to, though slightly
less than, the values derived by Groot et al. (GCN 10441) from the

Swift XRT observed GRB 100316D (Stamatikos et al. 2010, GCN10496)
in Windowed Timing (WT) mode in the 144-737 s time interval.
During this interval the light curve decays very slowly (decay
index alpha=-0.13, Starling et al. 2010, GCN 10505).
In addition, the 1.5-10 keV to 0.3-1.5 keV hardness ratio remains
constant (reduced chi2=0.91 with 97 degrees of freedom, dof).
Motivated by the high count rate (around 30 c s^-1, but far from
the pile up limit) and by the constant spectral shape we tried to
estimate the GRB redshift from the X-ray data.
We assume a Galactic column density of 7x10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et
al. 2005, A&A 440 775) and fit the WT spectrum taken from the
Leicester pages (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/00416135/)
with an absorbed (phabs*zphabs) cutoff power law model (the cutoff
power law model provides much better results in terms of column
density evaluation with respect to a simple power law model when
small spectral variations are present). Given the high count rate
we selected single pixel events only.
The resulting fit is good (reduced chi2=1.2, 333 dof). The redshift
is constrained to lie within the 90% confidence level (delta
chi2=4.61) of 0.014<z<0.28 (with a best fit redshift of z=0.1 and
intrinsic column density of N_H(z)=7x10^21 cm^-2).
Filtering WT counts with grades 0-2 (standard WT grades) slightly
shifts the best fit range to larger redshifts (in the approximate
range 0.1-0.6).

During this interval the 1.5-10 keV to 0.3-1.5 keV hardness ratio slightly
decayed, testifying for small spectral variations.
We assume a Galactic column density of 7.3x10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et

(tbabs*ztbabs) cutoff power law model within XSPEC (the cutoff power
law model provides much better results in terms of column density 
evaluation
with respect to a simple power law model when small spectral variations 
are present).
Data were grouped to have 30 counts per spectral bin. The resulting fit 
is good
(reduced chi2=0.9, 194 dof).
Filtering the data for single pixel events does not change the results.
In the intrinsic column density vs. redshift plane there is a low 
significance (3 sigma)
solution at low redshifts but the minimum lies at higher redshifts with 
a 2 sigma confidence
level solution of z=3.9+1.7-0.7 and N_H(z)=(5.5+9.8-2.1)x1022 cm-2.
Thus, even if we cannot exclude that GRB100413A is at low redshift, a 
high redshift (z~4),
highly absorbed (N_H(z)~6x1022 cm-2) solution is preferred.

Swift-XRT team:

Swift XRT observed the bright GRB 100704A (Grupe et al. 2010, GCN 10929)
starting 86 s after the BAT trigger. After strong X-ray flares the light 
curve started decaying
following a power law (Grupe 2010, GCN 10935).
We selected the time interval 4,510-28,896 s after the burst onset to 
collect the Photon
Counting (PC) spectrum. During this interval the spectrum is almost 
constant as testified by
a constant power law photon index (chi2=102 with 123 degrees of freedom).

We fit the PC spectrum (comprising 2002 counts) with a (Galactic plus 
intrinsic) absorbed
cutoff power-law model (tbabs*ztbabs*cutoff) within XSPEC (the cutoff 
power-law model
provides much better results in terms of column density evaluation with 
respect to a simple
power-law model when small spectral variations are present).
We assume a Galactic column density of 1.1x1021 cm-2 (Kalberla et al. 
2005, A&A 440 775)
and allowed for a 30% variability given its high value (and sampling all 
the values obtained
within 1 degree from the source).
We fit the spectrum using C-statistics. In the intrinsic column density 
vs. redshift plane there
is a low significance (3 sigma) solution at low redshifts but the 
minimum lies at higher redshifts
with a 2 sigma confidence level solution of z=3.6^+1.1 _-1.2 and N_H 
(z)=(9.7^+9.9 _-5.6 )x10^22 cm^-2 .
Thus, even if we cannot exclude that GRB100704A is at low redshift, a 
high redshift (z~3.5),
highly absorbed (N_H (z)~1x10^23 cm^-2 ) solution is preferred.
This compares well with the non-detection with UVOT (Kuin and Grupe 
2010, GCN 10934)
and MOA robotic telescope (Omori et al. 2010, GCN 10931).

of sight a 90% lower
limit on the metallicity of 0.03 solar can be set (based on the 
assumption that the absorbing
medium is not Thomson thick).

""We obtained a spectrum of the host galaxy of the proposed afterglow of 
GRB010921 (Price et al., GCN 1107) using the Double Spectrograph at the
Palomar 200-inch telescope, on 17 October 2001 UT.  Preliminary reductions
of the spectrum indicate a redshift of z = 0.450 +- 0.005, on the basis of 
4 emission lines, [O II] 3727, H-beta, [O III] 5007, and H-alpha.  The 
spectrum is typical for an actively star-forming galaxy, with no sign of 
an active nucleus.  Further analysis is in progress.

Assuming an H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m = 0.3, Omega_lambda = 0.7 cosmology,
we derive the luminosity distance of 8.30e+27 cm.  Using the fluence of 
1.0e-6 erg/cm2 (Ricker et al. GCN #1096), the total energy release in the 
restframe range 12-123 keV (redshifted bandpass of the HETE band at 8-85 keV) 
is 6.0e+50 erg.  Though no spectral information was reported, we estimate that 
the isotropic equivalent energy release in the 20-2000 keV range (see Bloom
et al. 2001, AJ, 121, 2879) was E_iso(gamma) = (2.65 +- 1.45)e+51 erg.

To conform with the constant energy of E_gamma = 5e+50 erg (Frail et al.

Swift BAT triggered on the early activity of GRB 100902A (Sakamoto et 
al. 2010, GCN 11181). Swift XRT started observing 316 s after the 
trigger observing the main event. By using the Swift/XRT spectrum 
repository at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/ (see Evans et al. 
2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177) we selected two time intervals with an almost 
constant hardness ratio. These are at the end of the main event between 
500-550 s (in Window Timing, WT, mode) and the entire first orbit in 
Photon Counting (PC) mode (between 600-3000 s). We then fit the two 
spectra with XSPEC using the model tbabs*ztbabs (cutoff), keeping the 
same absorption pattern and leaving free the cutoff power-law model for 
the two spectra (the cutoff power-law model provides much better results 
in terms of column density evaluation with respect to a simple power-law 
model when small spectral variations are present).
We assume a Galactic column density of 1.1x1021 cm-2 (Kalberla et al. 
2005, A&A 440 775) and we allow for a 30% uncertainty in the fit.  We 
fit the spectrum using C-statistics. In the intrinsic column density vs. 
redshift plane there is just one deep minimum hinting for a redshift 
z=4.5^+0.3_-0.2 (90% confidence level) and an intrinsic column density 
N_H(z)=(2.3^+0.5_-0.3)x1023 cm-2. The X-ray spectrum is very soft with 
Gamma~3.9 at the end of the prompt phase (with a cut-off energy >17 keV) 
and with Gamma~1.9 and E_cut~5 keV in the PC spectrum. The two spectra 
indicate the same redshift even separately.
The high redshift and the large absorbing column density are in line 
with the non-detection with UVOT and other ground based optical facilities.

covering the spectral range from 300 to 2500 nm. Due to technical
problems with the atmospheric dispersion corrector, the sensitivity of
the instrument was below the nominal value during this observation so
the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is very low.

In the spectra we detect a broad absorption line consistent with a
damped Lyman-alpha line and absorption features consistent with the MgII
doublet at a common redshift of z=2.106. Given the low S/N of the

report on behalf of the Swift Team:

GRB 101225A was detected by Swift BAT as an image trigger (Racusin
al. 2010, GCN 11493). Swift XRT started observing 1383 s after the
trigger observing the main event. The afterglow is very bright and
the XRT remained in the Windowed Timing (WT) mode for two consecutive
orbits. Within each orbit the spectrum remain constant as judged from
the hardness ratio and from the power law photon index.
We extract the XRT spectra for each of the first two orbits, separately.
We then fit the two spectra within XSPEC using the model
tbabs * ztbabs * (cutoff), keeping the same absorption pattern and leaving
free the cutoff power-law model for the two spectra (the cutoff power-law
model provides much better results in terms of column density evaluation
with respect to a simple power-law model when small spectral variations
are present).
We assume a Galactic column density of 7.9x10^20 cm-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005, A&A 440 775) and we allow for a 30% uncertainty in the fit. We
binned the spectra to 50 counts per energy bin and used the latest (v12)
response matrix. The detection in the UVW2 filter by UVOT (Siegel &
Racusin 2010, GCN 11499) constrains the redshift to be <1.4.
The fit with the cutoff power-law is relatively good with a reduced
chi^2 of 1.13 (508 dof).
Motivated by the similarities with GRB 060218 (extremely long duration,
soft prompt-emission spectrum, bright smoothly decaying X-ray afterglow
light curve, UV detection with optical non-detection), we fit the X-ray
spectrum including a blackbody component.
The fit improves considerably (and the cutoff energy goes well above the
XRT energy band, becoming unimportant for both spectra).
The new fit provides a reduced chi^2 of 1.07 (504 dof), based on an F-test
the addition of the blackbody component improves the fit by 4.2 sigma.
In the intrinsic column density vs. redshift plane there is just one
deep minimum hinting for a redshift z=0.07^+0.13_-0.04 (90% confidence
level) and an intrinsic column density N_H(z)=(1.5^+0.5_-0.2)x10^21 cm^-2.
The power law component shows a small softening from the first to the
second orbit, with a photon index around 2.2-2.4.
The blackbody component is hot with a temperature of ~1 keV, consistent
among the two observations. The blackbody radius decreases from the first
observation to the second from ~2x10^10 cm to ~0.6x10^10 cm.

extinction.

Also, additional R-band observation of the GRB011121 field carried out

further inspected our TNG images. The faint object reported by Malesani

We observed the afterglow of GRB 101219B (Gelbord et al., GCN 11473)

were taken on two epochs, 2010 Dec 20.17 and 2011 Jan 5.09 UT (11.6 hr 
and 16.4 days after the burst, respectively). Exposure times were 80 and 
120 min, respectively.

In the first-epoch spectrum, the afterglow is detected over the full 
spectral range from about 3200 to 22,000 AA. A careful analysis provides 
a tentative redshift z=0.5519 based on detection of weak Mg II and Mg I. 
No other clear features can be found at the same redshift either in 
absorption or emission.

The second-epoch spectrum was taken 16.4 days after the GRB, which 
corresponds to 10.6 days in the rest frame at z=0.55. The continuum is 
again detected, over the wavelength range 3500 to 22,000 AA, and is 
substantially redder. No narrow emission lines can be distinguished, but 
broad SN-like undulations are apparent, particularly around 8000 AA. We 
carried out a comparison of our spectrum with those of SN 1998bw (Patat 
et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 900) transformed at various redshifts. We find a 
convincing match at z~0.55 after comparing with a spectrum taken on 1998 
May 4 (i.e., 12 days after the GRB). The observed flux is consistent 
assuming a roughly equal contribution from a SN as bright as SN 1998bw 
and an underlying host galaxy. The match of the spectral shape, 
brightness, and spectral epoch together strenghten both the redshift 
determination and the existence of a SN associated with GRB 101219B.

GRB 110715A was detected by Swift/BAT (Sonbas et al., GCN 12158;
Ukwatta et al., GCN 12160),  Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al., GCN
12166), and Suzaku/WAM (Ohmori et al., GCN 12184). The prompt emission
of this burst has a high photon count rate. And the lightcurve shows a
multi-peaked structure lasting ~5s (i.e., T0+5s, where T0 is the
trigger time), followed by a much weaker emission up to ~T0+20s.
Therefore, the overall T90 duration is ~10s or even a bit longer. On
the other hand, such a lightcurve feature is reminiscent of previous
short bursts with extended tail emissions.

With the redshift z = 0.82 (Piranomonte et al., GCN 12164) and the
cosmological parameters H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27,
Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the isotropic energy release E_iso is (4.1 
0.4)x10^52 erg, the isotropic peak luminosity L_iso,p is (3.9 
0.2)x10^52 erg/s, and the rest-frame \nu_F\nu peak energy Ep_rest is
220  20 keV (Golenetskii et al., GCN 12166). Thus, the values of Eiso
and Ep_rest are well consistent with the Eiso-Ep_rest relation (i.e.,
Amati relation) for long GRBs (or collapsar bursts).

The Swift/BAT data were reduced in a standard way and a CCF method was
used to derive spectral lags upon the lightcurves with 0.064s binning
(Xu et al., ApJ, 696, 971). We found lags of 0.04+/-0.01s (1sigma) for
15-25 V.S. 25-50 keV and 0.04+/-0.01 (1sigma) for 50-75 V.S. 75-350
keV. Thus, this event also fits the Liso-spectral lag relation for
long GRBs.

At z=0.82, searching for an accompanying SN is doable but requires
very deep photometric follow-ups (ref. Tanvir et al., ApJ, 725, 625).",0.82,GRB110715A,Swift,Spectroscopic,0.82

alternatively represent Ly-alpha absorption with the highest redshift being

report:


High-resolution spectra of SN 2002ap were aquired using the
Echelle-spectrograph at the Tautenburg 2-m telescope on February 2.8 UT 
and 3.8 UT. The detector is a 2k x 2k CCD chip with 15 micron
pixels. The spectral resolution was R = 70 000 (0.04 Angstrom per
pixel; slit 1.04 arcsec). At the time of the observations SN 2002ap
was at an apparent magnitude of about V=12. The spectra were
reduced in a standard fashion. Wavelength calibration was performed
by means of ThAr lamps. The signal-to-noise ratio of the combined
images is about 30. This is sufficiently high to check the spectrum
for lines from the interstellar medium in the supernova host galaxy
(M 74).

In the combined spectra we detect an absorption feature at a
heliocentric velocity of (660 +/- 2) km/s what we attribute to
redshifted NaI D1 at the velocity of the host [1, 2]. For the D1
component we measure an equivalent width of (30 +/- 5) milli-Angstrom,
whereas the redshifted D2 component is blended with a telluric line.
Assuming that the empirical relation between the equivalent width of
Na I D1 and interstellar reddening in our Galaxy [3] is also
representative for the interstellar medium in M 74 we arrive at a
reddening in the supernova host of E(B-V) = (0.008 +/- 0.002)
mag. Thus, assuming a ratio of total-to-selective extinction of about
3, our data are in agreement with A_V (host) = (0.025 +/- 0.005)
magnitudes. In other words, at a projected distance of the supernova
of about 13.5 kpc from the center of M 74 (assuming a distance of 10
Mpc, [4]), the supernova light is nearly unaffected by dust in M 74.

We observed the field of GRB 120815A (Pagani et al., GCN 13645) with the 
VLT/X-shooter spectrograph. We confirm the presence of a bright, 
uncatalogued object consistent with the GROND position (Sudilovsky et 
al., GCN 13648). From the acquisition images, we measure R = 18.9 for 
the afterglow at an epoch of 1.67 hr after the GRB (calibrated to nearby 
USNO stars).

Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA, and were taken 
starting on 2012 Aug 15.163 UT (1.69 hr after the GRB), for a total of 
40 min exposure. Continuum from the afterglow is detected with high S/N 
in all of the UVB, VIS, and NIR arms.

The spectrum shows a wide trough and a multitude of strong absorption 
lines, which we interpret as due to a DLA and metal transitions of N V, 
S II, Si II, O I, C IV, Si IV, Fe II, Al II, Al III, Mn II, Mg II, Mg I, 
among others, at a common redshift z = 2.358. At the same redshift, we 
also detect fine-structure lines of Ni II and Fe II, thus confirming 
conclusively that this is the GRB redshift. We also detect intervening 
systems at z = 1.539, 1.693, and 2.00. In particular, the system at z = 
1.539 displays exceptionally strong Mg II, Mg I, and Fe II absorption.

We report on further analysis of the GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) optical/NIR imaging of the afterglow (Knust et al. GCN 13795, Klotz et al., GCN 13799, Yershov et al., GCN 13803, Kuin et al., GCN 13808) of GRB 120922A (Yershov et al., GCN 13793). Tying our photometric solution to field stars from the SDSS in the optical filters and 2MASS in the NIR, we derive the following AB magnitudes centered at a midtime of 00:01 UTC on September 23 (approx 1.5 hrs after the trigger):

GRB 121217A, following our theoretical considerations based on the Induced

We have considered the first 75 ks of the X-ray afterglow light curve of

More details on the model will appear soon on the arXiv.

We also predict a presence of a SN emerging after about 18 (+- 3) days

are tentative indications of other metal absorption features, although
they are weak and we have yet to establish their significance. The
lack of strong resonance metal lines, together with the low X-ray

also report a tentative evidence for an intervening MgII absorber at

We observed the field of GRB 120118B (Littlejohns et al., GCN 12852)

carried out on 2013 Feb 10 (389 days after the GRB), using the LRIS 
instrument, simultaneously in the g and I bands, for a total exposure 
time of 750 and 720 s, respectively. Consistent with the latest XRT 
position (Osborne et al. GCN 12857; see also 
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/), we detect a bright, slightly 
extended object (I = 23.8, Vega), which we consider to be the GRB host 
galaxy. Its coordinates are (J2000):

RA = 08:19:29.047
Dec = -07:11:05.14

This position is consistent with that of the tentative near-infrared 
counterpart reported by D'Avanzo & Palazzi (GCN 12870).

A spectrum of this source was taken on 2013 Feb 13 with the ESO VLT 
equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph, covering the wavelength range 
3000-20500 AA. The seeing was 0.6"". In the NIR arm, we detect several 
emission lines, interpreted as [O III] (5007), [Ne III] (3869), and 
hints for [O III] (4959) and [O II] (3727) at a common redshift z = 
2.943. The weakness/lack of other prominent lines usually seen in GRB 
host spectra is readily explained by their location in non-favorable 
parts of the spectrum. In the UVB arm, the host continuum is detected 
down to ~4750 AA, which corresponds to the onset of the Lyman alpha 
forest at z = 2.943.

At z = 2.94 the host is a fairly luminous galaxy at 2000  rest-frame, 
roughly 0.5 mag brighter than L* at that redshift (e.g. Gabasch et al.

At this redshift, the afterglow data imply a very high host exinction

N. Butler et al. (GCN 1426) suggested that a fading X-ray source, CXOU
J151455.8-192454 is the afterglow of the short hard burst GRB 020531
(Hurley et al. GCN 1407).  Fox, Kulkarni and Weissman (GCN 1427)
identified an object within 1 arcsecond of CXOU J151455.8-192454 and
suggested that the object is the host galaxy of GRB 020531. 

On June 12, 2002 (UT) we undertook imaging and spectroscopic
observations with the Echelle Spectrograph & Imager (ESI) on Keck II.
With a seeing of 0.6 arcseconds in the R and I bands we confirm that
the candidate object is indeed extended, with a size of about 1
arcsecond. Next, we obtained four 1800-s spectroscopic exposures
(Echelle mode) and found two features: a broad feature (Gaussian full
width at half maximum of 11.6 A) centered on 7455 Angstrom (A) and a
fainter feature centered around 9725 A.  We suggest that the broad
feature is the  [O II] 3728.8/3726.0 doublet with an intrinsic velocity
dispersion of 330 km/s and the fainter feature is Hbeta. If these
identifications are correct then the redshift of the candidate host
galaxy is 1.00.

The fluence and peak flux of GRB 020531 over the energy range 50 to 300
keV are 8E-7 erg cm^-2 and 6.4E-7 erg cm^-2 s^-1, respectively (Lamb et
al. 2002; astro-ph/0206151). Assuming, H0=65 km/s/Mpc and flat universe
with Omega-m=0.3, the isotropic energy release (without any k
correction) is 2.4E51 erg and 3.9E51 erg/s.

Lamb et al. (ibid) argue that GRB 020531 is a burst which belongs to
the short duration group. The isotropic energy release of this short

were carried out on 2010 July 8.2 UT (74.5 days after the burst),

32 min, respectively.

Consistent with the position of the NIR afterglow (Cenko et al., GCNs

A spectrum of this source was taken on 2013 March 11.3 UT with the ESO

range 3000-25000 AA. The exposure time was 8x600 s. In the NIR arm, we 
detect four emission lines, that we interpret as [O III](4959), [O

et al., GCN 11021) and Suzaku WAM (Tsai et al., GCN 11037).

Our late observations were performed on 2010-11-10, 105 days
after the trigger, and consisted of dithered images with a total of
4427 s exposure in g'r'i'z' and 3600 s in JHK under clear sky
conditions and a seeing of 0.8"".

Inside the enhanced X-ray error-circle
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions), we detect an extended

Its barycentric coordinates are:

RA (J2000) = 05:55:01.98

with uncertainties of 0.3"" in each coordinate.
Registering the early afterglow images (Olivares et al., GCN 11020)
against the late host frame, we derive an offset between galaxy
center and afterglow of approximately 0.4"".

A spectrum of this galaxy was taken on 2012-11-15 with the ESO VLT

wavelength range 3000-25000 AA. The seeing was 1.2"" and the
total exposure of our spectrum was 2400 s. In the VIS and NIR arm,
we detect emission lines, which we interpret as being due to
[O II](3729) and Halpha at a common redshift of z = 1.567.

The bright X-ray emission (Evans et al., GCN 11014), coupled with the
faint and red optical/NIR afterglow (Olivares et al., GCN 11020) is

Observations started at 07:15:31 UT on May 14th, 2 minutes after the SWIFT

average airmass of 1.18.

Inside the 2"".6 refined XRT error circle, we detect a source not visible

We performed the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis of 
GRB 130514A (Swift/BAT trigger #555821: Sonbas et al., GCN Circ. 14632, 
Ukwatta et al. GCN Circ. 14636). Since the Konus-Wind observed this GRB 
in the waiting mode, we only have 3 channel spectral data for the 
Konus-Wind which cover the energy range from 20 keV to 1.2 MeV.  The
joint spectral analysis of the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data allows 
us to derive the broad-band spectral parameters of this burst.

The time interval of the spectral data for each instrument is chosen 
from T0(BAT)-5.1 to T0(BAT)+153.9 s where T0(BAT) is the trigger time of 
BAT at 07:13:41 UTC. This interval comprises whole burst as observed by 
Konus-Wind and contains 87% of the total fluence in the 15-150 keV as 
observed by BAT (Ukwatta et al. GCN Circ. 14636).

The energy ranges which we used in the joint spectral analysis are 
20-1200 keV and 14-150 keV for the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT 
respectively.  The spectral data of two instruments are fitted with the 
spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to take into account 
the systematic effective area uncertainties in the response matrices of 
each instrument.

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law with exponential cutoff 
model: dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). No systematic residual 
from the best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument. 
The BAT constant factor is 0.83(-0.08,+0.10) (the KW constant factor is 
fixed to 1). The best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = 
-1.44(-0.14,+0.17) and Epeak = 110(-21,+42) keV (chi2/dof = 41.9/57). 
The best fit spectral parameters for the GRB (Band) model fixing beta = 
-2.5 are:  alpha = -1.44(-0.15,+0.17), and Epeak = 108(-21,+45)  keV 
(chi2/dof = 43.6/57). The energy fluence in the 15-1200 keV band 
calculated by a power-law with exponential cutoff model for this 159 s 
interval is 1.40(-0.16,+0.21)x10^-5 erg/cm2.

Assuming a photo-z of 3.6 (Schmidl, Kann, and Greiner GCN Circ. 14634) 
and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27, 
Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the isotropic energy release is E_iso = 
4.95(-0.67,+0.85)x10^53 erg in 1 keV to 10 MeV at the GRB rest frame 
extrapolating the best exponential cutoff function fit.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

following coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 14:23:34.08

Using R-band values from nearby USNO stars, we get a magnitude R = 16.7 +- 0.1 at a 
mean time of 0.41 hr after the GRB, where the error is dominated by calibration 
uncertainties.

A single spectrum of 900 s covering the range from 3800 to 8000 AA, with a resolution of 
~700, was obtained with a mean epoch of 0.598 hr after the burst. The spectrum presents 
a strong continuum with deep spectral features of AlIII, FeII, MgII and MgI at a common

afterglow of GRB020813 (Fox et al., GCN #1470) using UVES at VLT/Kueyen.
This resolution is 4 times better than the best resolution obtained so 
far for GRB OT spectra, confirming that this kind of observations is 
capable to map accurately the kinematics and metallicities of 
medium-high redshift galaxies. Observations consisted of 3 exposures, 
for a total of 7,700 seconds, covering the full spectral range 3500-9800 
Angstrom, in good seeing conditions (better than 1""). At the time of 
the observations the afterglow magnitude was R=20.4 and V=20.8 (see
Gladders & Hall, GCN #1513). 

A preliminary reduction of the spectra is already revealing the very
rich and complex structure of the ISM in the putative GRB host galaxy.
Strong absorption lines of MgI2852, MgII2803, MgII2796, FeII2344,

In the spectrum we also detect absorption lines at the same redshift, albeit at

between two sets of acquisition images, confirming that we are seeing 
afterglow and host light.  Hence, we consider z = 1.686 the likely redshift of

The X-ray observations of GRB 131202A (1) point to the possibility that it fulfills the IGC paradigm (2,3). A preliminary overlapping of its X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity within the one of GRB 090618, namely an IGC prototype (4), gives an estimate of the redshift of z~10 (see Fig. 1 http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB131202A_Fig1.pdf). Continuous monitoring and complementary observations in all possible wavelengths are encouraged.

The extension of the validity of the IGC paradigm to very large cosmological distances has already been clearly demonstrated by the case of GRB 090423 (5) at z=8.2 (6,7,8,9,10,11): its X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity again overlaps perfectly well with the one of GRB 090618 (see Fig. 2 http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB131202A_Fig2.pdf).

Under poor seeing conditions the afterglow was marginally

Nevertheless, we performed a spectroscopic sequence of 2x900s

Clear evidence of continuum flux is detected beyond 7600A, while
no flux is present in either spectra nor in a coadded spectrum

No other obvious emission or absorption features are present in
the spectrum, though the signal-to-noise ratio is not extremely
high.

If this break is due to Lyman-alpha, the implied GRB redshift
would be z~5.3.
We caution, however, that this line of sight is subject to high
galactic extinction (A_V= 2.8).

The late Swift/XRT observations of GRB 140108A (1,2) evidences the
fullfillment of the IGC paradigm (3,4). A preliminary overlapping of
its X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity with the one of GRB

of z=0.6 (+/- 0.1) (see Fig. 1

As a consequence, a supernova associated to GRB 140108A is expected to
emerge after 16 (+/- 3) days after the trigger.

Given the spectral parameters of the prompt emission by Swift/BAT
(<http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/583338/BA/>), this redshift
estimation leads to an isotropic energy of E_iso ~ 4x10^52 erg.

From the first acquisition image at May 7.21 UT, the afterglow has
m(R)=20.9 +/- 0.2 mag against the USNO-B1 (R2) catalog.

The spectra (8 x 600 s) started at May 7.21 UT and ended May 7.28 UT,

were delayed due to bad weather and had a mean epoch of 6:12 UT (3.59

not optimal, as the airmass at that time was ~1.8 and most of the observation

The spectrum shows a low S/N continuum, which is however, visible
between 5100 and 9500 A. Some absorption features seem to be present,
and in particular we identify a broad feature at 5300 A, with an observed
equivalent width of ~30 A. This could correspond to a weak Ly-alpha
(log(N_H/cm^-2) ~< 20) absorption at z=3.35. However, no other features
corresponding to that same redshift are seen, which is not unexpected for
a low density line of sight that would correspond to such a Ly-alpha feature
and a low S/N spectrum. Further absorptions could correspond to intervening
MgII absorbers.

We detect a variety of absorption features throughout the entire

We note the presence of a strong intervening system at z = 1.823

""We obtained imaging and spectroscopy of GRB 150101B/Swift J123205.1-105602 (Cummings et al. ATel 6871) with the ESO VLT on 4 Jan 2015, beginning at approximately 06:40 UT. At this epoch 1280s of I-band and1080s of z-band observations were obtained with FORS2 in ~1"" seeing. The known galaxy, 2MASX J12320498-1056010, is clearly detected in these images, and its light extends under the position of the candidate optical counterpart reported by Fong et al. (GCN 17271). We do not detect any point source at this location, although the combination of differing seeing, band and the underlying host galaxy mean that we cannot make any strong statements about the variability of the source. We additionally note that the 90% confidence of the refined XRT position (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_live_cat/00020464/) currently includes the nucleus of 2MASX J12320498-1056010, but not the source identified by Fong et al. 

In addition we obtained spectroscopic observations of 2MASX J12320498-1056010, covering the wavelength range 5300-8500A. The continuum is well detected across this wavelength range, with several prominent absorption features, most notably Mg b, and Na D at a preliminary redshift of z=0.134. We do not see any emission lines, although H-beta, [OIII] (4959,5007) and H-alpha all fall within our wavelength range at this redshift. We are not sensitive to the line identified by Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN 17278) as [OII] at z=0.093 since it lies blueward of our spectrum, but note that z=0.093 is not consistent with the observed absorption features. The absence of emission lines implies that the galaxy is a passive system. With an absolute magnitude of M_K ~ -25.5 (Vega), it lies the bright end of the luminosity function.

The properties of the galaxy are broadly similar to those of some short-GRBs (most notably GRB 050509B, Gehrels et al. 2005 Nature 437 851; Fong et al. 2013 ApJ 769 56). At z=0.134 the isotropic energy release, E_iso, would be approximately 1e48 erg, again in the energy range seen for other short-GRBs. However, the soft gamma-ray spectrum of the prompt emission is unusual, as is the long lived X-ray emission of the potential counterpart. The X-rays persist for several days post burst, at a luminosity of approximately 2e43 ergs/s. This is typical of an AGN, but such bright sources are unusual in the small BAT error box. The log(N)-log(S) of  Manners et al. (2003 MNRAS 343 293), predicts <10 sources of this flux or brighter per square degree (<~0.05 in a region the size of the BAT error box).  Furthermore, the optical spectrum does not show obvious signs of AGN activity. Hence it is likely, but not yet conclusive, that the X-ray source, and galaxy are associated with GRB 150101B/Swift J123205.1-105602.

If associated with a short-GRB we might expect the development of kilonova emission over the next few days which may peak at a H-band magnitude of around H(AB)=22-23, if similar to that seen in GRB 130603B (Tanvir et al. 2013 Nature 500 547, Berger et al. 2013 ApJ 774 23). Alternatively, the soft gamma-ray emission, prolonged X-rays, and location close to the nucleus of its host galaxy could be indicative of an unusual AGN outburst or tidal disruption flare.

the Konus-Wind which cover the energy range from 20 keV to 1.2 MeV.

The joint spectral analysis of the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data
allows us
to derive the broad-band spectral parameters of this burst.

The time intervals of the spectral data for each instrument are chosen
from T0(BAT)-102.150 s to T0(BAT)+159.866 s (the time-integrated spectrum)
and from T0(BAT)+95.098 s to T0(BAT)+118.650 s (the spectrum of the most
prominent pulse)
where T0(BAT) is the trigger time of BAT at 13:54:58 UTC.

The energy ranges which we used in the joint spectral analysis are 20-1200
keV and 15-150 keV
for the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of
two instruments
are fitted with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to
take into account
the systematic effective area uncertainties in the response matrices of
each instrument.

The spectrum of the most prominent pulse is well fitted with
a power-law with exponential cutoff model: dN/dE ~
E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak).
No systematic residual from the best fit model is seen in the spectral
data of each instrument.

The BAT constant factor is  0.71(-0.12,+0.16) (the KW constant factor is
fixed to 1).
The best fit spectral parameters are:
alpha = -1.01(-0.44,+0.65), and
Epeak = 96(-22,+56) keV (chi2/dof = 60/57).

The best fit spectral parameters for the GRB (Band) model fixing beta =
-2.5 are:
alpha =  -1.00(-0.51,+0.84), and
Epeak = 91(-26,+77) keV
(chi2/dof = 63/57).

The time-integrated spectrum is well fitted with a power-law model
with the the photon index 1.77(-0.09,+0.09), chi2/dof = 68/58.
The BAT constant factor is  0.70(-0.09,+0.11) (the KW constant factor is
fixed to 1).
The energy fluence in the 15-1200 keV band calculated by a power-law model
for this 262.016 s interval is 1.42(-0.19,+0.20)x10^-5 erg/cm2.

Assuming a redshift of 3.139 (de Ugarte Postigo and Tomasella, GCN Circ.
17710)
and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 67.3 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.315,
Omega_Lambda = 0.685,
the isotropic energy release in the 1 keV - 10 MeV energy range is
E_iso = 6.53(-1.29,+1.62)x10^53 erg.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

In the GCN 18263 (Levan et al. 2015), the galaxy NGC 3313 (z=0.0124, d=54 Mpc), which lies within the detection horizon of Advanced-LIGO/VIRGO, is presumed to be the host galaxy of GRB 150906B. Consequently, the isotropic energy of GRB 150906B is inferred Eiso~10^{49} erg. In the GCN 18259 (Golenetskii et al., 2015) from Konus-Wind, the time-averaged spectrum of GRB 150906B fitted by a cutoff power law gives the peak energy Ep = 928(-95,+111) keV in the observer's frame.

From previous GRB statistics (see attached figure [1] and ref. [2]), a typical short GRB with Ep~1 MeV corresponds to Eiso~10^{51} erg. With a fluence of 2.8(-0.2,+0.2)x10^{-5} erg/cm2 from GCN 18259, the redshift of GRB 150906B is expected to be z > 0.06 (266 Mpc), most probably z~0.12 (555 Mpc). Therefore the host galaxy of GRB 150906B could be one of the others nearby.

This type of short GRBs with Eiso < 10^{52} erg originate from merging neutron stars (NSs) leading to a massive NS and not to a black hole [3]. In view of the small value of the energetic, we indicate these sources as short gamma-ray flash (SGRF). As opposed to the more energetic short gamma-ray bursts, the SGRFs never have GeV emission.

+- 0.02 (Vega, assuming R = 16.31 for the USNO star at RA = 06:14:19.93,

A sequence of three spectra of 1200 s each was carried out starting on 
Dec 15.176 UT (1.2 hr after the trigger), covering the wavelength range 
3200-9000 AA.

A wide trough is visible superimposed on the afterglow continuum, 
indicating Lyalpha absorption from neutral hydrogen. We also detect 
several narrow absorption features, which we interpret as due to, e.g., 
Si II, O I, Al II, all at a common redshift of z = 2.59. A preliminary

The acquisition image was obtained under good conditions with a seeing of 0.8"".
The afterglow is clearly detected although it shows a strong decay in brightness
with respect to previous detections (Guidorzi et al. GCN18816, Saito et al. GCN

with only one prominent absorption feature centred at 5889 AA, with an 
equivalent width of ~30 AA. There are also tentative absorptions features 
at ~5300 and ~5340 AA. There is no drop bluewards of the 5889 AA feature

F. Chaffee and R. Goodrich (CARA/WMKO), on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-CARA
GRB collaboration, report:

We obtained spectra of the host galaxy of GRB 980613 (see GCN Circ. 114 and
117) at the Keck-I telescope, on 17 Dec 1998 UT.  The reduced spectrum shows
a single strong emission line at 7814 Angstroms, which we interpret as the 
[O II] 3727 line at z = 1.0964 +- 0.0003, a probable 4000-A break just to
the red of it, and a very blue, featureless continuum blueward of the line.  
Other plausible spectroscopic identifications of this line (e.g., Ly alpha,
Balmer lines, [O III], etc.) would predict appearance of other strong 
emission lines or continuum breaks, which are clearly not seen in our data.  
We thus consider our redshift interpretation to be secure.  The spectrum is 
typical of star forming galaxies at comparable redshifts.

Both the continuum and the line emission are clearly extended.  The images
of the galaxy (which is coincident with the OT discovered by Hjorth et al.,
1998, GCN Circ. 109), show a patchy or asymmetric morphology, suggestive of
an interacting system.

In what follows, we assume the Galactic foreground extinction A(V) = 0.27 mag
from Schlegel et al. (1998, ApJ 500, 525), and a simple Friedman model 
cosmology with H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_0 = 0.2, and Lambda_0 = 0.  At this 
redshift, the luminosity distance is 2.256e28 cm.

The extinction-corrected spectroscopic magnitudes of the host are: B = 24.4, 
V = 24.1, and R = 23.85 mag, with the zero-point uncertain by at least 0.2 
mag.  This is in an excellent agreement with the R-band magnitude in a 
comparable aperture, derived from direct images obtained at the Keck-II 
telescope on 28 Nov 1998 UT, and consistent with our earlier estimate (GCN 
Circ. 117).  

From the BATSE fluence of 1.71e-6 erg/cm2 (Woods et al. 1998, GCN Circ. 112) 
the implied isotropic gamma-ray energy of the burst was 5.2e51 erg.

The extinction-corrected [O II] line flux is 4.4e-17 erg/cm2/s, giving the
line luminosity of 2.8e41 erg/s.  The implied unobscured SFR, using the
conversion from Kennicutt (1998, ARAA 36) is 3.9 Msun/yr.  The observed, 
extinction-corrected monochromatic flux at the rest wavelength of 2800 A is 
0.9 microJy, corresponding to the restframe power of 2.76e28 erg/s/Hz.  The 
implied unobscured SFR, using the estimator from Madau et al. (1998, ApJ 498,
106) is 3.5 Msun/yr, in an excellent agreement with the [O II] line estimate, 
although both may be uncertain by as much as 20-50%.  This agreement suggests 
that the host galaxy as a whole is not heavily obscured.  We note that this 
SFR is rather moderate, despite the very blue color of the host galaxy.

in seven filters (g'r'i'z'JHK) started at 01:13 UT on 2016-03-03
(80 h after the GRB) and consisted of images with a total
integration time of 72 minutes in g'r'i'z' and 60 minutes in JHK.

The source reported as candidate afterglow in our earlier imaging
(Delvaux et al. GCN #19114) has faded beyond the detection limit
of the new data (r' > 25.1 mag in the AB system), confirming it
as the optical afterglow of GRB 160228A.

The nearby source (angular separation of 1.7"") mentioned in
Delvaux et al. (GCN #19114) is still clearly present and located
at

RA (J2000.0) = 07:09:15.79
Dec. (J2000.0) = +26:55:52.4

with a preliminary brightness of r' = 24.2 +/- 0.3 mag.

The chance coincidence probability of finding an unrelated object
of this magnitude within a distance of 1.7"" is 0.04
(following Bloom et al. 2002, AJ, 123, 1111), and we hence
consider this object as a host galaxy candidate of GRB 160228A.
While the chance coincidence probability is quite low, we note
that the angular separation would be unusually large for long GRBs.

coordinates of (J2000.0, +/-0.5""):

R.A.: 09:46:48.56
Dec.: +54:00:46.3

We also note the presence of two other sources within 2.5 of the GRB

Spectroscopy of the GRB afterglow and the first of the two other objects

suggesting that this object is unrelated to the GRB. The afterglow 
spectrum is indicative of a Lyman-alpha drop at a redshift between 4.90

at Paranal, Chile. The total exposure time was 1 hour in the 300V and

also GCN 1952), as well as a nearby reference object.

shows very strong absorption over the range 516-545 nm, presumably a
complex of Ly alpha clouds around z = 3.3-3.4. The detection of
numerous narrow lines is consistent with this interpretation: we can
identify these with metal-absorption lines (SiII, OI, CII, SiIV, CIV,

The continuum trace is well detected in our exposures, down to ~3100 AA.
The lack of any drop sets an upper limit to the redshift z < 1.55. A 
number of superimposed absorption features are detected, which we

Observations were obtained in the r and z bands. The candidate afterglow (Xu et al.

This variability confirms the source as the afterglow of GRB 160821B.

The offset of the afterglow from the candidate host galaxy is approximately 5.5, corresponding to a physical offset of 15 kpc.

We observed the field of GRB 1601001A (Page et al., GCN 19967) with the 
ESO Very Large Telescope Unit 2 (Kueyen) equipped with the X-shooter 
spectrograph.

Close to, but outside, the enhanced XRT position (Osborne et al., GCN 
19969), in our acquisition image we detect a bright, pointlike source at 
coordinates RA = 04:47:40.71, Dec = -57:15:36.8. This source is faintly 
visible in the archival DSS data and is pointlike in our images (0.75"" 
seeing).

A spectrum was secured of this object, for a total of 4x600 s, starting 
on Oct 1.299 UT (6.1 hr after the GRB). The continuum is consistent with 
a stellar spectrum, and we conclude that this target is not associated 
with GRB 161001A.

Our slit, at a position angle of 319.6 deg (CCW from north), does 
however cover a portion of the XRT error circle. Within the wings of the 
the PSF of the DSS object, approximately 0.8 arcsec SE, we detect a 
number of emission lines which are consistent with [O II], Hbeta, [O 
III] and Halpha at a common redshift of z = 0.891, revealing the 
presence of a background object. While we cannot accurately determine 
its position from the slit information alone, that is consistent with 
being at the edge of the XRT error circle. Our images also hint a faint 
extension of the DSS object at a position consistent with that of the 
emission lines, which could represent the continuum emission of the 
object. As such, this is a candidate host galaxy of GRB 161001A.

We caution that we have no way to confirm the association between the 
emission line object and the GRB. No variability can be inferred from 
our data, and as we lack an estimate of the continuum flux, we can not 
presently quantify the chance association probability.

mounted on the Magellan/Baade 6.5-m telescope at a mid-time of 2016 Nov
7.170 UT (2.77 days post-burst). We obtained 6x360-sec of r-band exposures

sources reported from GROND (Nicuesa Guelbenzu et al.; GCN 20132) and
Gemini (Troja et al.; GCN 20137) imaging. Given the relatively poor seeing,
accurate photometry of the individual sources is challenging. However, the
sources appear to have similar relative flux levels as previously reported,
suggesting a lack of significant variability in any of these sources. We
note that Source A (Nicuesa Guelbenzu et al.; GCN 20132) is fully
coincident with the latest XRT position*, while the three remaining sources
are on the outskirts of the position.

In addition, we obtained 3x1800-sec of spectroscopy with Magellan/IMACS on
2016 Nov 8 UT in 0.6"" seeing at an airmass of 1.1.  We used the 200 line
grism and the f/2 camera to cover 4000-10000 Angstroms. The slit was
aligned through Sources A and B (Nicuesa Guelbenzu et al.; GCN 20132) and
also serendipitously passed through a nearby extended source 6.1"" from the
center of the XRT position (Source X; RA=5:11:34.77, Dec=-51:27:41.8). The
spectrum of Source A exhibits a red continuum indicative of an early-type
galaxy with prominent Ca II H+K stellar absorption lines at z=0.793. Source
B has a faint trace with a single possible emission line of unknown
identification near 9780 Angs. The spectrum of Source X is also that of an
early-type galaxy at z=0.788. We note that both Sources A and X lack
prominent emission lines of either [O II] 3727 or H-beta.  The similarity
in the redshifts of Sources A and X, their early-type galaxy spectra, and
the abundance of extended sources in the vicinity of the XRT position may

We report on further analysis of our data (Malesani et al., GCN 20260) 
taken at the Nordic Optical Telescope for GRB 161214B (D'Avanzo et al., 
GCN 20257). The best-seeing images (~0.9"") clearly reveal two blended 
objects within the XRT error circle, separated by <1 arcsec, with 
comparable brightness (at ~2.2 hr after the GRB). As first suggested in 
GCN 20260, the likely interpretation is the near-superposition of the 
afterglow of GRB 161214B and an unrelated, foreground object. 
Astrometric registration of our images with the SDSS frames shows that 
the afterglow is slightly south of the SDSS source.

A spectrum of the complex was secured using the AlFOSC spectrograph, 
covering both objects. Observations started on 2016 Dec 14.82 UT (2.42 
hr after the GRB) and consisted of 2x20 min exposures using grism #4, 
covering the wavelength range 3500-9400 AA. A few absorption lines are 
apparent, and there is a hint that their spatial extent on the trace is 
offset to the North (consistent with the SDSS source location). The two 
most prominent features can be identified as the Mg I b triplet and the 
Na I D doublet at redshift ~0, confirming that the SDSS object is a 
Galactic star (probably of K or early M type). One more feature is 
observed at ~4238 AA, whose identification is unclear. One possibility 
is the Ca I 4226 A resonant line at z = 0, sometimes observed in K 
stars, which would however require an offset of the wavelength 
calibration in the blue part of our spectrum.

No features which can be clearly attributed to the afterglow are 
detected in our spectrum. Marshall & D'Avanzo (GCN 20268) report 
detection of the afterglow in the UVOT UVW2 filter, at a flux level much

From the acquisition image prior to the spectroscopy, a new optical transient is
clearly detected in the outskirts of the putative host galaxy (L. Izzo et al.

RA(J2000) = 11h 09m 39.573s Dec.(J2000) = -12d 35' 17.37""

clear emission lines are superposed on it identified as Halpha, [N II] 6584, and
[S II] 6717/32 located at z = 0.0368, suggesting an association with the nearby

report on a preliminary analysis of the Swift XRT data. Swift XRT started
observing GRB171205A (D'Elia et al. 2017, GCN 22177) 145 s after the 
trigger.
XRT detected a bright X-ray source decreasing from ~80 c/s to ~10 c/s
from 150 s to 400 s, remaining in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (Kennea et al.
2017, GCN 22183).
The hardness ratio light curve does not imply appreciable spectral
variations during this time interval.
We fit the WT spectrum binned to 20 counts per energy bin with an absorbed
power law (with the column density fixed to 5.9e20 cm-2, Willingale et al.
2013, MNRAS 431 394).
We obtain a reduced chi2=1.23 (239 degrees of freedom, dof, and 9e-3 null
hypothesis probability, nhp).
The inclusion of an intrinsic absorption component at the GRB redshift
(z=0.0368, Izzo et al. 2017, GCN 22180) does not improve the fit, rather
we can only put a 90% confidence level upper limit of N_H(z)<0.3e20 cm-2.

Given the relatively low nhp of the fit we include a soft blackbody 
component.
The fit improves considerably with kT_BB=0.10+-0.02 keV (90% c.l.) and
equivalent radius R_BB~5e11 cm (for a source distance of 163 Mpc).
The fit is good with a reduced chi2=1.09 (237 dof and 0.15 nhp).
F-test provides a probability for a chance improvement of 6e-8.
The 0.3-10 keV blackbody contribution to the total flux is ~4%.

We checked that the fit does not improve using different values for the
Galactic column density (NH_DL=4.82e20 cm-2 or NH_Kalberla=4.91e20
cm-2), reaching similar results.
Using a spectrum made from grade 0 events does not change the
results and the blackbody component is still significant.",0.0368,GRB171205A,Swift,Spectroscopic,0.0368

We observed the optical counterpart (e.g. Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 23237) 
of GRB 180914B, detected by AGILE (Ursi et al., GCN 23226; Verrecchia et 
al., GCN 23231), Fermi/LAT (Bissaldi & Longo, GCN 23232), and Konus-Wind 
(Frederiks et al., GCN 23240). We used the X-shooter spectrograph on the 
ESO VLT UT2 (Kueyen), for a total exposure of 2x600 s, starting on 2018 
September 17.07 UT (2.30 days after the GRB). The covered wavelength 
range is 3000-21000 AA, and the seeing was relatively poor, around 1.5"".

 From a 15-s acquisition image, we measure the magnitude of the 
afterglow as r = 20.37 +- 0.04 (AB), calibrated against the Pan-STARRS 
catalog.

Several absorption features are detected superimposed on the afterglow 
continuum. Among them, we identify Mn II, Al III, Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, Ca 
II, all at the common redshift of z = 1.096. At the same redshift, 
fine-structure lines from Fe II are also identified, thus firmly 
establishing this value as the GRB redshift. A few emission lines from 
the underlying host are also visible. We identify the [O II] doublet and 
[O III] 5008, while other commonly observed features lie at this 
redshift in regions of poor atmospheric transparency or low S/N.

We note that our spectroscopic value is larger than the photometric 
redshift of the putative host galaxy as listed in the SDSS catalog 
(https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr14/en/tools/explore/Summary.aspx?id=1237680331629267013), 
which is however based on low-S/N photometry. At z = 1.096, the 
isotropic-equivalent energy radiated in gamma-rays is 3.6*10^54 erg, 
using the Konus-Wind fluence (1.15*10^-3 erg cm^-2; Frederiks et al., 
GCN 23240). This ranks among the highest measured values for GRBs.

spectra with increasing exposure time were collected; in this analysis we
consider only one with 600s exposure obtained in a Rapid Response Mode at
06:18:24.9 UT (at the start of observation, 0.37 hr after the GRB).

A bright continuum is observed across the entire wavelength range covered
by X-shooter. Several absorption and emission features are detected, which
can be identified as due to H-alpha and [OIII]5007/4959 in emission at z =
1.39. At this same redshift we also detect AlII1854/1862, SiII1808, the
MgII doublet, and MgI in absorption. Fine-structure lines from FeII and
NiII are also detected at z = 1.39, which makes the redshift association
with the GRB secure. An intervening system at z = 0.67 with absorption
features due to the MgII doublet and MgI is also identified in the

Spectroscopy covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA was carried out

4x600 s exposure time.

In a 5-s image taken with the acquisition camera on 2018 Oct 10.023 UT, 
we measure for the afterglow R ~ 17.3 (Vega), assuming R = 18.34 for the 
USNO star at RA = 00:55:51.53, Dec = -47:23:14.5.

The spectrum has a very high S/N. A wide trough is easily visible around

detection of a plethora of absorption lines, including Al II, Al III, S 
II, O I, Si II, Si IV, C IV, Zn II, Cr II, Ni II, Fe II, Mn II, O I*, Si

We have analysed the data obtained using the MUSE instrument, mounted on the ESO VLT UT4 (Yepun) telescope in Paranal, of the Fermi GRB 180703A (Racusin et al., GCN #22883; Poolakkil &  Meegan, GCN #22896). MUSE is an integral-field-unit spectrograph which covers a field of view of up to ~1 arcmin**2. Our observations started on 2018 July 04 at 07:53:56 UT, 10.92 hr after the GRB detection, and consisted of four exposures of 250 s each.

When we integrate the data cube along the full MUSE wavelength range, we detect a source within the uncertainty of the Swift/XRT afterglow position (Gibson et al., GCN #22891), and consistent with the position of the reported optical counterpart (Guidorzi et al., GCN #22892, #22944). We extracted a spectrum of this source within the wavelength range 4750-9350 AA. The spectrum is noisy, and we cannot confirm continuum afterglow emission. However, we identify three strong emission lines which can be consistently interpreted as [O III] 4960,5008 AA and [O II] 3727/29 AA at a common redshift of z = 0.6678. Given the spatial coincidence with the optical counterpart, we propose that these features come from the GRB host galaxy and we conclude that this is the redshift of GRB 180703A.

days after the GRB detection. The slit was centred on the nucleus of the 
nearby object visible in the Pan-STARRS archival images, and was 
oriented in order to include the afterglow position.

While only weak continuum is visible, several clear emission lines are 
detected in the near-infrared arm. We identify the [O ii] 3727/3729 
doublet, Hbeta, [O iii] 4959, and [O iii] 5007, at a common redshift z = 
2.469.

No clear emission (lines nor continuum) is detected at the location of 
the afterglow, so we have no direct measurement of the GRB redshift. The 
random association probability with the Pan-STARRS object is however 
rather small (~3*10^-3), suggesting a physical connection. We also note 
that the Pan-STARRS galaxy is exceptionally luminous, with an absolute 
magnitude M = -22.9 AB (computed at 1800 AA rest frame). The measured 
offset would correspond to 6.6 kpc in projection - a rather large value

Our spectrum, secured with grism #4, covers the approximate wavelength

The spectrum is typical of an old stellar population, and is unlike that 
of long-duration GRB host galaxies. The association of this object with 
GRB 191019A is therefore unclear.

      R = 20.76 +- 0.04.

This value is based on a calibration with Landolt standard stars.

U0900_00213423  00:54:50.131  +01:12:10.33  18.90 +- 0.04

Note as the above magnitudes are fainter than those given by USNO, 
by about 0.4  mag. This may indicate a non photometric night, or 
that the USNO catalog is not particularly accurate in this region 
of the sky.

Starting on Oct 7.10 UT, a low resolution (R ~ 1000) spectrum of the 
transient was also obtained. Observations consisted of three exposures, 
for a total exposure time of 1 hour, and cover the full spectral range 
3800-8000 A. The observed spectrum has a relatively low signal-to-noise 
and does not show any strong obvious emission line. The most prominent 
absorption feature is at 4800 A. If this feature is identified with the 
blend of the MgII lambda2803,2796 doublet, a redshift of z=0.712 is 
implied. If this is the case, the MgI lambda2852, FeII lambda2382,2374 
and FeII lambda2344 transitions might coincide with other absorption 
features in the spectrum, although each single line is not statistically
significant. 

At the estimated  redshift the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy of 
the burst is E = 1.5x10^52 erg (2-400 keV), adopting the fluence reported 
by Galassi et al. (GCN 2770),

(GCN #2735, 2734) with the FORS2 long slit spectrograph on the 
ESO VLT (Antu) on 10 October 2004, approx. 15.75 days after burst.  
The first spectrum was taken at 05:10 UT using the 300V grism, with 
an exposure time of 1800 s; the second spectrum was taken at 05:48 UT 
using the 300I grism, again with an exposure time of 1800 s. We used 
a 1 arcsec slit. The total wavelength range is approx. 400 - 950 nm. 

We find weak emission lines in the spectra, which we identify with
[OII] 3727, [NeIII] 3968.9, H gamma, H beta and [OIII] 4959,5007.
All of these lines are consistent with a redshift z = 0.859.

The presence of [NeIII] implies a galaxy with a significant 
population of massive stars. The isotropic energy of the burst is 
E_iso=1.48x10^52 erg, using the 25-100 keV fluence value from HETE 
and a cosmology with H_0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_matter=0.3 and 
Omega_lambda=0.7. As the lightcurve breaks fairly early on, the true 
energy is likely to be much lower.
The presence of continuum features relating to a supernova
can only be determined after further analysis: a SN1998bw-like bump 
would be expected to peak at approximately t_V~23.5 days, t_R~25 days and

Spectra of the host galaxy of GRB 970228 were obtained in the course of
several runs at the Keck-II 10-m telescope.  A prominent emission line at 
6319 A was observed in at least 3 independent data sets, along with a very 
blue continuum, showing no apparent breaks between about 4000 and 8900 A.  
We interpret this emission line as [O II] 3727 at z = 0.695 +- 0.002.
Moreover, possible emission lines are detected corresponding to [Ne III] 
3869 and [O III] 5007 at the same redshift.  We thus consider this redshift
to be practically secure.

Assuming a cosmology with H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_0 = 0.2, and Lambda_0 = 0, 
we derive the luminosity distance of 1.28 e28 cm.  The measured fluence from
Ulysses (cf. Hurley et al. 1997, ApJ, 485, L1) of 4.3 e-6 erg/cm2 then implies 
E(gamma,isotropic) = 5.2 e51 erg.

We detect continuum flux in the V band of about 0.12 uJy, uncertain by at 
least 20%.  This is in an excellent agreement with the published ground-based 
and HST photometry, corresponding to V ~ 26 mag.

The [O II] line has the equivalent width 75 +- 15 A (observed), or 44 +- 9 A 
(restframe), typical for star-forming galaxies at comparable redshifts.  The
very blue continuum suggests little restframe extinction in this galaxy.

In the following estimates, we assume a Galactic extinction correction A(V) = 
0.75 mag.  From the [O II] line flux, we estimate SFR = 0.47 Msun/yr, and from
the continuum power at 2800 A (rest), SFR = 0.35 Msun/yr.  Both of these are 
uncertain by at least 30%.  The absolute restframe B band luminosity of the 
galaxy corresponds to about 0.05 to 0.1 L_* today.  Thus, neither the SFR 
nor the SFR per unit mass are especially high.

(Blanch et al., GCN #29075) GRB 201216C (Beardmore et al., GCN #29061, 
Malacaria et al., GCN #29073, Nadella et al., GCN #29074) with the ESO 
Very Large Telescope UT 3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter

started at 01:30 UT on 2020-12-17, 2.38 hr after the burst, and 
consisted of 4 exposures of 600 s each.

The afterglow is well-detected in the stacked spectrum, but the 
continuum is very red. As a consequence, the S/N drops dramatically from 
the red to the blue end. We identify a doublet which we tentatively 
match to Ca II H & K at z = 1.10. Unfortunately, no other lines are 
detected to confirm this value, though most of them would fall in a 
spectral region of poor S/N. We note that Ca II H&K absorption is 
uncommon in intervening absorbers, making it likely this is the actual 
redshift of the GRB, and that it does not lie at an even greater 
distance (in accordance with the VHE detection).

A redshift of z = 1.1 would place this object among the most distant 
known VHE sources. Using the Fermi GBM parameters (Malacaria et al., GCN 
#29073), we derive a an observer-frame 10-1000 keV isotropic energy 
release of E_iso = (4.71 +/- 0.16) * 10^53 erg.

Based on our grz photometry (Izzo et al., GCN 29066), we measure a 
spectral slope beta_opt = 4.1 +- 0.2 (Fnu propto nu^-beta), which is an 
unusually red value, suggesting significant extinction. This is 
confirmed by the optical-to-X-ray spectral index, beta_OX ~ 0.1 which 
indicates a very low optical/X-ray flux ratio, making this a bona fide 
dark GRB.

A power-law fit to the afterglow light curve (Ho et al., GCN #27799; Kumar et al., GCN #27800, #27804; Perley & Ho, GCN #27805) suggests that ZTF20abbiixp was at r=21.5 and g=21.8 at the time of Gemini observation.

The spectrum was reduced using the IRAF package for GMOS. A trace was detected redwards of 4900 AA. Bluewards of 4900 AA, the source was not significantly detected, probably because of the faintness of the object, the intrinsic red color of the afterglow (g-r ~ 0.3 mag) and low sensitivity at the blue end.

We clearly identified absorption lines of Mg II 2796 and Mg II 2803 at the redshift of z = 1.256 in the three individual exposures. Absorption from Mg I 2852 is marginally detected in the combined spectrum at consistent redshift.

In a 60 s image taken with the acquisition camera on May 05.02 UT, we 
detect the optical afterglow, for which we measure an AB magnitude r' = 
21.11 +- 0.04 mag (calibrated against nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS 
catalog).

We clearly detect continuum over the wavelength range of the entire 
spectrum. A trough is visible around 3740 AA, which we identify as due 
to H I. From the detection of several absorption features, which we 
interpret as due to Si II, C II, C IV, Fe II, Al II, Mg II, among 
others, as well as the Lyman forest, we infer a redshift z = 2.077.

al., GCN 30036) using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the

3000-21000 AA, and consist of 4 exposures by 600 s each. The observation 
mid time was 2021 May 17.387 UT (3.82 hr after the GRB).

In a 30 s image taken with the acquisition camera on May 17.364 UT, we 
detect a single object consistent with the UVOT-enhanced XRT position 
(Beardmore et al., GCN 30034), at J2000 coordinates:

RA = 23:52:53.95
Dec = -39:06:08.3

We measure for this target an AB magnitude r = 22.3 +- 0.1 (calibrated 
against the Legacy Survey, but only very few, faint stars are present in 
the acquisition camera field of view). We note that at the same 
position, to within the uncertainties, there is a faint object visible 
in the Legacy Survey, with AB magnitude r ~ 23.7. We conclude that the 
above source is the optical afterglow of GRB 210517A, and the archival 
object is its host galaxy.

In our spectra, continuum is detected over the whole observed range. A 
prominent emission line is detected around 4236 AA, which we identify as 
Ly alpha in emission. This interpretation is confirmed by the detection 
of both emission lines in the near-infrared arm (corresponding to [O II] 
and [O III]), and a plethora of metallic absorption features, among them 
Si II, Si IV, O I, C IV, C II, all at a common redshift z = 2.486. 
Consistent with the detection of bright Ly alpha in emission, the 
observed HI absorption column density is low.

We note that at z = 2.486 the galaxy is a particularly bright GRB host, 
with an absolute AB magnitude M(1800 AA) ~ -21.5.

r>23.5
I=20.3+-0.1
z=19.4+-0.1

Spectroscopy of the source reveals a continuum well detected in the red 
part of visible arm. A clear break is detected around 9000AA which we 
interpret as the Lyman-alpha break at z = 6.318, and explains the strong 
r-z color as due to Lyman dropout. Other lines such as Fe II, Al II, C 
IV and Si II are visible and display a double absorption profile, which 
is possibly due to different intervening systems at z1 = 6.312 and z2 =

We observed the field surrounding the candidate afterglow (source #2) of 
the short GRB 211106A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 31049; D'Elia et al., GCNs 
31051, 31068) with the ESO VLT equipped with the MUSE panoramic 
integral-field spectrograph, covering a square 1'x1' region around the 
XRT position. Spectra of each spaxel cover the wavelength range 
4750-9350 AA. The mean time of our observation was November 10.03 UT 
(3.84 days after the GRB).

We report the redshift of three galaxies close to the XRT error circle 
(D'Elia et al., GCN 31068; see also Malesani et al., GCN 31070):

#1)
RA = 22:54:20.29
Dec = -53:13:53.6
z = 0.097 as inferred by the detection of the [O iii] doublet and Hbeta 
in emission.
The projected separation from the center of the XRT error circle is 
4.8"", or 8.6 kpc at z = 0.097.

A bright, pointlike object (RA = 22:54:20.32, Dec = -53:13:56.7) is 
spatially blended with this galaxy, which we confirm to be a star thanks 
to the detection of Balmer and Ca II absorption at z = 0.

#2)
RA = 22:54:21.31
Dec = -53:13:47.2
z = 0.294 as inferred by the detection of the [O iii] doublet and Hbeta 
in emission.
The projected separation from the center of the XRT error circle is 
7.9"", or 34.9 kpc at z = 0.294.

#3)
RA = 22:54:20.34
Dec = -53:13:40.8
z = 1.012 as inferred by the detection of the (resolved) [O ii] doublet 
in emission.
The projected separation from the center of the XRT error circle is 
8.3"", or 67.0 kpc at z = 1.012.


While the association of these sources with GRB 211106A cannot be 
confirmed based on our data, object #1 has the smallest chance 
association probability. With R ~ 21.5, using the formula by Bloom et 
al. (2002, AJ, 123, 1111), we compute a chance association probability 
of ~5%.


Stacking the MUSE cube along the wavelength axis, faint emission is also 
detected inside the XRT error circle, consistent with our FORS2 image 
(Malesani et al., GCN 31070). The S/N is too low to extract any spectral 
information, and no emission lines are identified.

the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) instrument mounted on the 
2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt Graham, AZ, USA). Data were obtained at the 
mid time of 12:40 UT on 2021-11-06, ~13.6 days after the burst trigger.

At the position of the UVOT localization (Kuin & Dichiara, GCN 30975) 
and the Legacy Survey object (Pozanenko et al., GCN 30972), we detect 
the GRB host galaxy (Sakamato et al. GCN 31038, Rastinejad et al. GCN 
31002). We measure the following AB magnitudes:
g = 24.02+-0.17
r = 23.99+-0.15
calibrated against Pan-STARRS field stars and not corrected for Galactic 
extinction.

Spectroscopy of the source was obtained for a total of 4550s, covering 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA.Continuum is faintly detected over 
the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA, and a single emission line is 
visible at ~6940 AA. The most likely interpretation is [O II] at z = 
0.862. At this redshift, [O III] would unfortunately fall on top of a 
region affected by sky lines, so its non-detection is not very 
constraining. Other interpretations are less likely. We can disregard 
Lyalpha, since there is no drop in the continuum blueward of the line. 
We deem Halpha unlikely, as the corresponding redshift z = 0.057 would 
imply an extremely faint host galaxy (absolute magnitude ~ -13), and we 
don't see the expected [O III] and Hbeta lines. The interpretation of 
the observed feature as [O III] 5008 seems to be also unlikely as we 
would expect to detect hints of [O III] 4959 as well as Halpha which 
would fall in a wavelength region clean of skylines.

Assuming the redshift z=0.862, standard cosmology (Planck 2016) and 
Swift/BAT refined and on-line automated spectral analysis (Laha et al., 
GCN 30979, and http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1080859/BA/ 
<http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1080859/BA/>) we estimate an 
isotropic-equivalent radiated energy Eiso (1-10000 keV) of about 
(0.9-1.2)x E^51 erg, which is typical of short GRBs. However, we note that:
a) despite its short duration, the burst has a rather soft spectrum 
(simple power with index ~2) which is consistent with a spectral peak 
energy Ep close to (or even below) the BAT low-energy threshold and 
would imply a rest-frame peak energy Ep,i < ~30-40 keV, thus locating 
this GRB in the region of the Ep,i - Eiso plane populated by long GRBs. 
The preliminary automatic modelling with a cut-off power-law or a Band 
function is consistent with a larger Ep,i, which would make this burst 
more similar to other short GRBs, but with a very large uncertainty.
b) the soft spectra and short duration put GRB 211023B closer to the 
region populated by long GRBs than to to the one populated by short 
events also in the HR-T90 diagram, even though it is still consistent 
with belonging to the tail of the distribution of short GRBs in this plane.

H-beta, indicates that these are two star forming galaxies.

At this redshift, the projected distances to the two galaxies at ~3.4"" 
and ~13"" from the afterglow corresponds to ~13 and ~50 kpc. The distance 
between the two galaxies corresponds to 63 kpc, similar to the distance 
between the Milky Way and the SMC. There is at least another galaxy (RA, 
DEC = 05:21:04.01, +01:18:49.23) within 0.5 arcmin with similar 
photometric redshifts (SDSS DR16), suggesting that the two galaxies are 
probably not isolated, but part of a larger group.

If GRB 210919A was at z = 0.2411, using standard cosmology (Planck 2016) 
and the analysis of the BAT spectra (Barthelmy et al., GCN #30863 and 
http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1073893/BA), we find that it would be 
consistent with the population of short GRBs in the Ep,i - Eiso plane.

The optical spectra were obtained with the Multi-Object Double 
Spectrographs (MODS) instrument mounted on the 2x8.4-m LBT telescope 
(Mt. Graham, AZ, USA) at ~11 UT on 2021-03-07, ~16 days (i.e. ~12 
rest-frame days) after the burst trigger. The spectra covers the 
wavelength range 3200-10000 AA, and we obtained a total of 6 exposures 
of 900s. The resulting spectrum has been corrected for Galactic 
extinction (A_V = 0.025 mag).

The slit was place in order to cover both the host galaxy and the GRB 
position. In addition to the host spectra, a second trace is well 
visible in the 2D image of the spectrum although superimposed to the one 
of the host galaxy. Its low S/N extracted spectrum shows features 
similar to those exhibited by XRF-associated SN2006aj at a similar phase 
(Mazzali et al. 2006, Nature, 442, 1018). This confirms the bump 
observed by Belkin et al. (GCN 31736) as due to the emerging

increases the efficiency of the J and H bands, resulting in a wavelength 
coverage between 3000 to 21000 AA. 

In a preliminary reduction we detect two weak emission lines that we

[OII]4960 at a common redshift of z=1.1137+/-0.0002. The other line of 
the OII doublet, [OII]3729 is affected by a sky line and is consequently 
not detected. H-alpha falls within a telluric absorption and H-beta in a 
spectral region of low sensitivity, both resulting in non detections. Given 
the spatial coincidence of these emissions with the afterglow, we identify 
the underlying object as the host galaxy and propose this as the redshift 
of the GRB.

We observed the candidate optical afterglow (de Wet et al., GCN 32289)

Lalla et al., GCN 32283) using the ESO VLT equipped with the MUSE 
integral-field spectrograph. Observations were carried out starting on 
2022 June 29.06 UT (1.17 days after the trigger), and cover the 
wavelength range 4800-9300 AA.

A broad trough is detected centered around 4960 AA, which we interpret 
as due to DLA HI absorption. A number of metal lines are also detected, 
which we identify as, among others, O I, O I*, Si II, Si II*, C II, C 
II*, Si IV, C IV, Al II, at a common redshift z = 3.084. We also note 
the presence of a (rich) intervening system at z = 2.665 (as identified 
by, e.g., S IV, Si II, C IV, Fe II, Al II).

The redshift and luminosity of this object, together with its X-ray 
emission (Evans et al., GCN 32284), make it very likely to be the 
afterglow of GRB 220627A. Using the preliminary GBM fluence and spectral 
parameters (Roberts et al., GCN 32288), we derive an 
isotropic-equivalent quasi-bolometric gamma-ray energy of 3.6*10^54 erg

counterpart to GRB 990510 (Vreeswijk et al.; GCN #310) with the

11.21 UT. We identified the following ultraviolet absorption lines: 
Fe II (2344 and 2600 Angstrom), Mg II (blend of 2796 and 2803). These
lines are redshifted by z = 1.619 +- 0.002 (this may be a lower limit
to the redshift of the GRB source). On the basis of this redshift we
also find some weaker features, such as Al III (1863), Cr II/Zn II

Assuming isotropic emission, z = 1.619, H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc and

X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal). Our target was
the faint object visible in the archival optical images from the Legacy Survey,
coincident with the optical and X-ray afterglow, first noticed by
Rastinejad et al. (GCN 32208).

The observation was performed on 2022 September 23 (104 days after the GRB)
and consisted of 4x1200 s in the UVB and VIS arms and 8x600 s in the NIR arm.
A filter was adopted to block part of the K band which in return increases
the efficiency of the J and H bands, resulting in a wavelength coverage
between 3000 to 21000 AA.

In a preliminary reduction, we detect several strong emission lines that
we identify as Lyman-alpha, [O II] 3729, [O III] 4959 and [O III] 5007 at a
common redshift of z = 2.3608 +/- 0.0002. The [O II] 3726 and H-beta lines
are affected by sky lines and are consequently not clearly detected. H-alpha
falls outside the covered wavelength range.

This result is supported by a VLT/MUSE spectrum obtained on 2022 August 24,
covering the wavelength range 4800 to 9300 AA, which shows no emission nor
absorption features, consistent with the measured redshift from X-shooter.

The positional coincidence between our target and the optical and X-ray
afterglow suggests a physical association. Furthermore, our spectra show
that the archival counterpart is a star-forming galaxy, akin to a typical
long GRB host. Our observations bring thus evidence that the GRB was not
physically associated with the local, nearby galaxy MCG-06-10-007 at z = 0.049
(Cenko et al., GCN 32191), and their proximity is a chance coincidence.

Several, weak absorption features can be identified, which we interpret

individual lines have low S/N, the combined detection of multiple

limit absorption produced by the host of the GRB. 
 
2.  The flux blueward of ~5870 Ang is 'patchy', i.e. indicative of the Lya 
forest.  A broad absorption feature is present at 5820 Ang, which we 
interpret as the Lya absorption due to the ISM of the host galaxy.
 
3.  We identify a strong absorption feature at 6040 Ang, which is consistent
with SiII1260 at z=3.793.

An object is present at a consistent location in the Legacy Survey, but

the optical afterglow of GRB 230325A.

Only a faint continuum is detected from this source, which allows us to

the T193cm telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France) equipped 
with the MISTRAL spectro-imager. This time, we targeted in spectroscopy 
the galaxy close to the GRB line of sight: WISEA J101316.01+481158.7, at 
r'SDSS(PSF) = 19.6 (AB). Two exposures of 900s were obtained in the blue 
configuration (4200A-8000A) from 2023 28 April 00:25:02 UT to 2023 28 April 
00:55:59 UT. The wavelength calibration was performed using the MISTRAL 
calibration lamp, exposed just after the science observation. Data were 
reduced using the ASPIRED package (https://github.com/cylammarco/ASPIRED) 
configured for MISTRAL data.

In the combined frame, we clearly detect the [NII]@6548A, Halpha, [NII]@6583A, 
and [SII]@6718A. Halpha is the dominant line of the spectrum. Based on these 
lines, we inferred a redshift of z = 0.1524 +/- 0.0005, in good agreement 
with the SDSS photometric redshift of z = 0.13 +/- 0.03.

The GRB is at an offset of ~18 arcsec from the WISEA J101316.01+481158.7 
center. At the redshift of this galaxy, the burst would have a projected 
offset of ~48 kpc and a probability of chance coincidence of ~0.16, 
which is not commonly observed for the long GRB population. For this reason, 
this object is probably not the host galaxy of GRB 230427A.

The optical spectra of the two candidate host galaxies were obtained with the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) instrument mounted on the 2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt. Graham, AZ, USA) on 2023-03-04, 27 days after the burst trigger. The spectra cover the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA, with a total of exposure time of 1.5 hours.

We detect a faint and red continuum with few emission lines for the brightest galaxy that we tentatively identify as H-alpha, and H-beta at a common redshift of z=0.429 (consistent with the photometric redshift of z = 0.484 ± 0.090 provided by SDSS, see Tomasella et al., GCN 33302). The spectral trace of the fainter galaxy is too weak to allow a reliable identification of any emission line, thus not permitting its redshift estimate.

Multiband photometry was also collected between June and July (4-5 months after the GRB trigger) in the r, z and H bands, with both galaxies detected in all filters. These images also show an additional fainter host galaxy candidate at coordinates 13:28:16.56 +46:43:34.7, underlining the complexity of the field.

Observations started at 07:58 UT on 2023 Oct 25.

The spectrum is dominated by emission lines, that can be interpreted as strong He II 4686 (with a blue shoulder possibly associated with NIII / CIII) together with H-alpha and H-beta on top of a blue continuum, at a common redshift z = 0.056. The spectrum is consistent with those of very young supernovae that demonstrate flash-ionisation features a few hours to days after shock breakout (e.g. Gal-Yam et al. 2014, Nature, 509, 471). This is consistent with the non detection of the transient by ATLAS just 8 hours prior to the GOTO discovery. A comparison with SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that the best matching template is that of SN 1998S at 12 days before maximum. Based on photometry reported by Iglesias-López et al. (GCN 34881), the transient absolute magnitude is around M_r = -18.8 (AB).

Considering the large GRB uncertainty region (12.6 deg radius) and its short duration, GOTO23baj/AT2023vuc is likely unrelated to GRB 231024A. However, this is a very young supernova and further observations are encouraged.

The highest redshift features include Lyman alpha, SII 1250,53,59, SiII1260, 1304, OI1302, CII 1334, SiIV1393, 1402, CIV 1548, 1550, AlII1670, FeII 1608, 1611 at a common redshift of z=2.305. We also identify fine structure lines of SiII* 1264 and 1309 at the same redshift, which we hence assume as the redshift of the GRB. Additionally, we detect two intervening systems, at z=2.076 showing CIV and SiIV absorption and at z=0.574 showing the MgII 2796, 2803 doublet.

We have obtained 2 x 30 minute spectra of the host galaxy of GRB 050416
(a) with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer mounted on the 10-m
Keck I Telescope.  Observations were taken on 6 June, 2005 UT.  We
identify several emission lines including [OII], H-beta, H-gamma, and H-
delta at a redshift of z = 0.6535 +/- 0.0002.

The spectrum indicates the host galaxy is faint and blue with large
amounts of ongoing star formation.  We note the redshift is consistent
with the prediction of Fox (3408) based on the afterglow detection in
the Swift UVOT UVW2 filter.  

Using a fluence of 3.8e-7 erg/cm^2 (10 - 350 keV, GCN 3273), we find an

Observations were carried out in twilight, at high airmass 2.3 to 2.5.

Despite the low elevation, in a single r-band image taken with the acquisition camera, we clearly detect the optical afterglow (Lipunov et al., GCN 35684; Fernandez-Garcia et al., GCN 35686; Dutton et al., GCN 35687; Ferro et al., GCN 35694; Fernandez-Garcia et al., GCN 35696). We measure r' = 19.05 +/- 0.07 (AB) calibrated against two nearby SkyMapper stars.

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we detect a continuum down to at least 3200 AA implying z < 1.6 from the lack of damped Lyman-alpha absorption. Multiple absorption features are detectd, consistent with being due to Fe II and Mg II at a common redshift z = 0.824. While the modest S/N does not allow to identify any fine-structure lines at this redshift, due to the lack of unidentified features we consider z = 0.824 the likely redshift of GRB 240205B.

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we clearly detect a continuum over the entire wavelength range. From detection of multiple absorption features, which we interpret as being due to Fe II, Mg II, AlIII, Ca II, and Fe II*, we infer a common redshift of z = 0.946. We conclude this is the redshift of the burst. We also detect emission lines ([O II] and [O III] doublets, and H_alpha) at a consistent redshift, which we interpret as being due to the GRB host galaxy. As noted by Gompertz & Malesani (GCN 35824), the host galaxy is also detected in the Legacy Survey with r ~ 24.2 and a photometric redshift z ~ 0.9, which is consistent with the value we measured.

report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed a candidate host galaxy of GRB 050709 with the Gemini
North telescope and GMOS spectrograph at 2005 July 13.58 UT.  The
observations were made under clouds, at high airmass, and with morning
twilight interfering with the some of the observations.

The source acquired is the brighter of the two sources reported by
Jensen et al. (GCN #3589; ""Source B"").  The long slit likely does not
cover the position of the fainter of the two sources which is coincident
with the Chandra source (""Source A"").

We have reduced 2x900 sec integrations and identify emission lines at
approximate observed wavelengths of 7617A and 5810A which we associate
with Halpha and [O III]5007 at an approximate redshift of z = 0.16.
Fainter emission lines are observed at 5754A and 5641A, corresponding to
[O III]4959 and Hbeta, and thus we believe the redshift is secure.

If source A is the afterglow of GRB 050709, then it is seen in
projection about 3 kpc from Source B, suggesting that Source B may be
the host galaxy.  The similarity of this case with the previous
potential association of the short/hard GRB 050509B with a low-redshift
galaxy (Bloom et al., GCN #3386) is suggestive.  If GRB 050709 is at z =
0.16, then the isotropic-equivalent energy release is about 6 x 10^49
erg (based on Butler et al., GCN #3570).

A definitive measurement of the distance scale to short/hard GRBs awaits
the demonstration of variability of the X-ray or optical emission.  We
encourage deep observations to ascertain the nature of Source A and, in
particular, to search for variability.

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 240419A (Siegel et al., GCN 36169; Schneider et al., GCN 36175) using the ESO VLT UT2 (Kueyen) equipped with the UVES high-resolution spectrograph. Observations were automatically performed via the rapid-response mode (RRM) system. The observations consisted of a series of spectra taken on April 19 with the first one starting at 02:15:42 UT (27.7 min after the GRB). The spectra cover a wavelength range from 3700 to 9300 AA and were obtained at a relatively high airmass of 2.4.

In the spectrum of 700 s, we only detect a continuum in the upper chip of the red arm (7770 to 9300 AA). From the detection of multiple absorption features, which we interpret as being due to SII, OI, Si II, Si II*, CII, CII*, Si IV, we infer a common redshift of z = 5.178. We conclude this is the redshift of the burst. This is consistent with the absence of flux in the blue dichroic, which covers the wavelength range from 3300 to 5000 AA, and which is entirely blue-ward of the Lyman break at z = 5.178. We also note the presence of additional absorption features likely due multiple intervening systems.

We obtained observations of the location of the X-ray transient LXT 240402A (Xu et al., GCN 36016; Jia et al., GCN 36022; Levan et al., GCN 36025), coincident with GRB 240402B detected by GECAM-C (Xue et al., GCN 36017) and Konus-Wind (Ridnaia et al., GCN 36028), using the X-shooter spectrograph at the VLT. Observations began at 04:04 (UT) on 03 May 2024, approximately 31 days after the trigger. The spectrum covers a wavelength range roughly 0.31 to 2.1 mum, with a total integration time of 4800 s.

A weak continuum is seen throughout the spectrum, and we clearly detect emission lines of [O II], H-beta, [O III], H-alpha, and tentatively Ly-alpha, at a common redshift of z = 1.551. We propose that these lines are from the host of the transient. Based on the gamma-ray fluence seen by Konus-Wind in the 20 keV - 10 MeV band (Ridnaia et al., GCN 36028) we conclude an isotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays of 4.7x10^52 erg. This places it very close to the mean Amati relationship (Amati et al. 2006 MNRAS 372 233), and thus is consistent with a long-GRB origin.

report:

We have performed a joint fit to the WXM and FREGATE spectral data
for GRB 050709, in order to refine the numbers initially reported in
GCN 3570 (Butler et al. 2005) for the short and long pulse components.

The short pulse is well-fit (chi2/DOF= 35.37/48) by a power-law times
exponential model with photon index alpha = -0.7 +/- 0.2 and nu-F_nu peak
energy Epeak = 83 +18/-12 keV.  The energy fluences of the short pulse
are

S_E(2-30 keV)   = (9.3 +/- 0.9) x 10^(-8) erg cm^-2 and
S_E(30-400 keV) = (2.9 +/- 0.4) x 10^(-7) erg cm^-2.

The X-ray to gamma-ray fluence ratio is thus 0.32.  The t90 duration of
the short pulse is 220 +/- 50 ms in the 2-25 keV energy band and 70 +/- 10
ms in the 30-400 keV band.  The t90 duration and Epeak of the short
pulse are consistent with those found for short/hard GRBs (see, e.g.,
Ghirlanda, Ghisellini, & Celotti 2004, A&A, 422, L55 for plots of the
short/hard GRB Epeak distribution).

The long pulse is well fit (chi2/DOF = 108.86/138) by a power-law model
with photon index beta = -2.2 +0.2/-0.4.  The energy fluences of the
long pulse are

S_E(2-30 keV)   = (7.1 +/- 1.5) x 10^(-7) erg cm^-2 and
S_E(30-400 keV) = (3.9 +4.1/-2.7) x 10^(-7) erg cm^-2.

These spectral results are preliminary because there is a linear trend
in the background that affects the spectral analysis of the long pulse
and has not yet been taken into account.  The t90 of the long pulse is
130 +/- 7 s in the 2-25 keV energy band.

Using the redshift of z = 0.16 measured by Price et al. (2005; GCN 3605),
the isotropic-equivalent energy of the short pulse in the 1-10,000 keV
energy band in the rest frame of the source is

Eiso (short pulse) = (2.7 +1.1/-0.3) x 10^(49) erg,

using Omega_M=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7, and h=0.65.  The Eiso and Epeak
values for the short pulse place it well off of the Amati et al. (2002;
A&A, 390, 81) relation for long duration GRBs.

Taking a time interval 0.060 s in the rest frame of the source
(corresponding to t90 = 0.07 s in the 30-400 keV energy band in the
observer frame) and assuming the same cosmology and energy band as
used above for the Eiso determination, the luminosity of the short
pulse in the 1-10,000 keV energy band in the rest frame of the source
is

Liso (short pulse) = (5.2 +/- 1.4) x 10^(50) erg s^-1.

Taking even this short time interval, the Liso and Epeak values for the
short pulse place it off the Yonetoku et al. (2004; ApJ, 609, 935)
correlation for long duration GRBs.

2-25 keV and 30-400 keV bands can be found at

The observation was performed on 2024 July 02 (13.8 days after the GRB). It consisted of 4 exposures of 600 s each and covered the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA.

The target is faintly detected in the r-band acquisition image, with an AB magnitude r ~ 22.8 (calibration is difficult due to paucity of calibrators in the field). This is significantly brighter than the archival object visible in the Pan-STARRS and Legacy surveys, first noticed by Gompertz et al. (GCN 36715), and likely includes a transient contribution.

In a preliminary reduction, we detect several strong emission lines that we identify as  H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, the [O II] doublet, [O III] 4959, [O III] 5007, and [Ne III] 3869 at a common redshift of z = 0.3965, which is lower than the photometric value reported in the PS1-STRM catalog (Beck et al. 2020) for galaxy PSO J162.3946+17.2828. We therefore propose this to be the redshift of the GRB.

The Legacy survey images also show a second, fainter object about 1.7"" west of the optical afterglow position. This was also included in the slit, and we measure for it z = 1.338 from detection of [O II] and H-alpha. Given the larger offset, we consider this galaxy to be unrelated to the GRB.

We observed AT 2024vlp (GOTO24fzn), the likely afterglow (Gompertz et al., GCN 37522; Jiang et al., GCN 37526; Beardmore et al., GCN 37531) of GRB 240916A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 37518; Pawar, GCN 37519) using the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal). The observation was performed on 2024 September 16 (23.1 hr after the GRB), and consisted of 4 exposures of 600 s each covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA.

In images taken with the acquisition camera, the optical afterglow is well detected. In the r band, we measure an AB magnitude of r ~ 19.4, calibrated against three nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog. This magnitude is significantly fainter than that reported by Jiang et al. (GCN 37526), confirming the fading nature of this object and thus the identification of this source as the afterglow of GRB 240916A.

In a preliminary analysis of the spectra, we clearly detect continuum over the entire wavelength range. A trough is visible around 4350 AA, which we identify as due to HI Lyman-alpha absorption. In addition, from detection of a plethora of absorption features, which we interpret as being due to O I, O I*, Si II, Si II*, C II, C II*, Si IV,  C IV, Fe II, Fe II*, Cr II, Zn II, Ni II, Ni II*, Mn II, Mg II, we infer a common redshift of z = 2.610, which we conclude is the redshift of GRB 240916A. There is a tentative detection of H-beta emission at z=2.610 from the underlying host galaxy. We also note the presence of an additional intervening absorption system at z = 2.214.

At the location of the optical afterglow of GRB 241010A (Dichiara et al., GCN 37755), an object is visible in the Legacy survey, first noticed by Jiang et al. (GCN 37771). This is most likely the GRB host galaxy.

On 2024 November 2, once the field became visible to ground-based observatories, we secured spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy using the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) equipped with the OSIRIS+ instrument. Three spectra of 900 s each were obtained, using the R1000R grism, which covers the wavelength range 5150-10200 AA.

On top of clear continuum, a multitude of emission lines are visible, which we interpret as due to [O II], [Ne III] 3869, Hdelta, Hgamma, Hbeta, [O III] 4958 and [O III] 5006, all at a common redshift z = 0.977, which we suggest to be the redshift of GRB 241010A.

wavelength range (split into two observations of a total of 60min
using one dichroic beam splitter and 40min using the other), with an
approximate resolving power of 46,000 (6.5 km/s).

We obtain a redshift of z=2.6147 (and therefore confirm the redshift
reported by Prochaska et al., GCN 3833) from the detection of numerous

column density of log N(HI)=21.0 and metallicities of [Si/H]=-0.6 and
[Fe/H]=-1.1.

In addition, an intervening metal absorption line system with log

We observed the optical afterglow (Qiu et al., GCN 38600) of the SVOM GRB 241217A / EP241217b (Brunet et al., GCN 38594; William et al., GCN 38599; Zhou et al., GCN 38606) with the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal). The observation consisted of 4x1200 s with a mid-time at 2024-12-18 06:52.46 UT (13.93 hr after the trigger).

In images taken with the acquisition camera, the counterpart is detected with AB magnitude r = 23.44 +/- 0.11 (mid time 13.1 hr after the trigger), which is about 1 mag brighter than the archival value from the Legacy Survey (r = 24.35 +/- 0.14). The target contained thus a mix of both afterglow and host galaxy light.

From a preliminary reduction of the spectra, a faint continuum is detected in the NIR arm from 10500 to 18000 AA, likely due to the afterglow. A single emission line is very significantly detected in the near-infrared arm at 14410 AA. We note that this wavelength region is severely affected by telluric absorption, whose effect could slightly shift the observed line centroid. No other strong lines are confidently detected. 

The likely interpretation is that the emission line is from [O III] 5007 AA at z = 1.879. At this redshift, other commonly observed emission lines, Halpha, Hbeta and [O III] 4959 all fall in regions of strong telluric absorption. A marginal detection of an emission line at 18990 AA is consistent with Halpha strongly attenuated by telluric absorption at this redshift. A low-significance emission feature can also be seen corresponding to [O II] 3729.

An alternative scenario would be that the emission line is due to Halpha at z = 1.196. In this case, we would expect to detect [O III] 5007 around 11000 AA, a region free from telluric absorption. Significant dust extinction must be invoked to suppress it and the other nebular lines.

The photometric redshift determination of the extended object visible in the Legacy Survey (z = 1.20 +/- 0.48; Zhou et al. 2021, MNRAS, 501, 3309) does not allow to strongly discriminate between the two values. We also warn that for such a faint object the Legacy Survey photometric redshifts are prone to systematic errors.

Even if the detection of a single line is ambiguous for redshift determination, we view the option z = 1.879 as the more likely scenario and we propose it as being the redshift of GRB 241217A / EP241217b. Further analysis is ongoing, and we will update the community should this reveal a stronger conclusion regarding the burst redshift.

The observation was carried out with mid-time 06:35:08 UT on 2024 December 29 (~1.1 days after the trigger).

In the image taken with the acquisition camera, we detect the proposed optical afterglow (Kumar et al., GCN 38684 and GCN 38691; An et al.

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we clearly detect a continuum over the entire wavelength range. From the detection of a broad Lya absorption at ~4470 AA and multiple absorption features, which interpreted as being due to NV, SII, SiII, OI, CII, SiIV, CIV, FeII, AlII, AlIII, NiII, CrII, ZnII, MgII, MgI, SiII*, OI*, CII*, FeII*, NiII*, we infer a common redshift of z = 2.674. The detection of fine-structure lines confirms the afterglow nature of the source, and we conclude this is the redshift of the burst. A strong Lyman alpha emission line is detected at a consistent redshift, which we interpret as being due to the GRB host galaxy.

We also note the presence of additional absorption features likely due to multiple intervening systems at z = 2.000 and z = 1.824.

The 0.2-10 keV light curve XRT (started 6089 seconds after the BAT

law index of -0.4+/-0.2 (90% confidence level).
The power law fit is better than a constant fit at a 3.3 sigma

previous XRT circular (Campana et al., GCN3872) is the X-ray
afterglow of GRB050824.

The 307 photons in the 0.3-10 keV evergy band were also used for

In the UBV arm, the trace is dominated by the afterglow continuum. Absorption features are detected corresponding to Mg II and Fe II, at a consistent redshift, which we suggest is the redshift of the burst.

We should note the presence of a possible, weak emission feature at 16,855 AA at the position of the afterglow trace. We are not able to identify this feature presently and a full reduction of the data is required to ascertain its reality.

At the position of the NW object, a faint, red continuum is detected in the VIS and NIR arms. No clear emission or absorption features are detected, and at the moment we can not provide a redshift determination for this object.

We thank Alan Watson (UNAM) for providing us with accurate coordinates of the afterglow. We acknowledge expert support from the ESO staff in Paranal, in particular Francesca Lucertini and Rodrigo Palominos.

In the acquisition image, obtained 21.328 hr after the burst, the afterglow is detected at a magnitude of r_AB=21.72 +/- 0.05, indicating a slight rebrightening with respect to the OHP observation (Schneider et al. GCN 39767) obtained 1.6 hr earlier. Further monitoring of this behaviour is encouraged.

The spectrum shows continuum above 4000 AA, with features consistent with at least two low-column density Lyman systems at redshifts of z=3.442 and 3.447 (or a dynamic separation of 1500 km/s), likely corresponding to the same galaxy or system. There are tentative detections of SiII, SiII*, OI, SiIV, CIV, FeII and AlII a those same redshifts, which we identify as corresponding to the GRB.

Additionally, we identify two intervening absorbers, one at z=3.196 with absorptions in several Lyman lines, SII and SiII, and a second one at z=1.029 showing the MgII doublet.

In a 10-s r-band exposure taken with the acquisition camera (1.58 hr after the SVOM trigger), a source is well detected at the location of the counterpart reported by Watson et al., GCN 39915 with a magnitude r = 21.9 +/- 0.1 (AB, calibrated against a single Pan-STARRS object). Our measurement is consistent with Wang et al. GCN 39917 and confirms the fast fading nature of this source and its likely association with GRB 250329A.

Our spectra, covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA, consist of 4 exposures of 600 s each. The observation mid time was on 2025 Mar 29.2611 UT (1.97 hr after the SVOM trigger).

Due to its spatial coincidence, this is the likely GRB host galaxy.

We obtained two spectra of 1000 s each with the X-shooter instrument, starting at 07:08:05 UT on 2025 April 3, i.e. about 36.5 days after the Swift trigger. The observations were obtained under good conditions, with a measured seeing of 0.5"".

Emission lines are detected in the visible and near-infrared arms, which we identify as H-alpha, [O III] 5007 and the [O II] 3726,3729 doublet at a common redshift of z = 0.950. This value is consistent with the photometric solution z_phot = 1.12 +/- 0.18 from the Legacy Survey (Zhou et al. 2021, doi:10.1093/mnras/staa3764). The absolute magnitude of the galaxy is M_B ~ -21, which is at the bright end of the distribution of long-duration (collapsar) GRB hosts. Our redshift measurement rules out an association between the object in the Legacy Survey and ESO 340-26 at z = 0.018.

The spectroscopic observation was conducted using the GMG-2.4m telescope with Grism #14, which provides a wavelength coverage of 3600–7460 AA. A single 1800s spectrum was obtained, with exposure beginning at 2025-04-04T15:18:24, about 0.98 hours after the Fermi/GBM and EP/WXT trigger (Fermi GBM team, GCN 40050; Hu et al., GCN 40051).

Two absorption systems were identified in the spectrum. 

For the first absorption system, we detected multiple metal absorption features, including Si II at 1527 AA, Al II at 1671 AA, Al III at 1855 AA and 1863 AA, Zn II/Cr II at 2026 AA and 2062 AA, and Fe II at 2344 AA, 2374 AA, and 2383 AA. These features consistently indicate a redshift of z ~ 1.881. 

For the second absorption system, the spectrum shows multiple metal absorption lines from Si II/S II at 1260 AA, O I/Si II at 1303 AA, C II at 1335 AA, Si IV at 1394 AA, Si II at 1527 AA, Fe II at 1608 AA, and Al III at 1863 AA. These absorption features correspond to a redshift of z ~ 2.627. 

These results support a redshift of z ~ 2.627 for the transient, consistent with the measurement reported by Xinglong-2.16m (Zhu et al., GCN 40061).

The 300V grism with no order-blocking filter was adopted, covering the wavelength range 3300-9600 AA (with potential second-order contamination redward of 6600 AA). Observations started on 2025 April 4 at 02:15:01 UT (10.99 hr after the burst). Two exposures of 600 s each were obtained.

From a 60 s acquisition image obtained on 2025 April 4 at 02:01:37 UT (10.76 hr after the burst), we measure R ~ 21.1 +/- 0.2 mag (AB) calibrated against nearby Pan-STARRS objects.

From a preliminary reduction of the spectrum, continuum is detected over the wavelength range 3600-9600 AA. While the spectrum is noisy blueward of 3720 AA, we can set an upper limit to the redshift z < 2.06 due to the lack of Lyman forest. Four clear absorption features are apparent in clean regions of the spectrum, three of which match Si IV 1393, Si IV 1402 and the (blended) C IV doublet 1548,1550 at a common redshift z = 1.847. The fourth line seems marginally split and could be an intervening C IV doublet at z = 1.763, although no other features are seen to confirm this value.

The observed absorption system is somewhat peculiar (but not unprecedented), as some typically strong low-ionization features common in long GRB spectra (de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2012, doi:10.1051/0004-6361/201219894) are either non-detected or only marginally detected. This indicates a high-ionization environment, which has been previously linked to systems with low H I column density (e.g. Jakobsson et al. 2006, doi:10.1051/0004-6361:20066405; Thoene et al. 2011, doi:10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18408.x; Vielfaure et al. 2020, doi:10.1051/0004-6361/202038316).

In a 60 s acquisition image in the r-band, starting on 2025-04-17 at 21:27:11 UT (10.24 after the Fermi trigger), an object is detected at the position of the optical afterglow (Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 40116), with a magnitude r = 22.48 +/- 0.06 (AB, calibrated against nearby Pan-STARRS objects). At a consistent location, the Legacy Survey also reveals a source, the likely GRB host galaxy, with a somehow fainter magnitude r = 22.65.

In our spectrum, we clearly detect an emission line at 7317 AA. Considering the most likely options for this feature (Halpha, Hbeta, [O III], [O II]), the interpretation more consistent with the data is the (unresolved) [O II] 3727/3729 doublet at z = 0.963. In all other cases, we would expect to see other features which would fall over well-covered regions of the spectrum, which are not observed. We thus suggest that this is the redshift of the host galaxy of EP250416a.

The spectrum shows tentative absorption features at the expected locations of Mg II (2796, 2803 AA) and Mg I (2852 AA) at z = 0.962, although the signal to noise in the blue region of the spectrum is badly affected by the bright Moon, hence we cannot conclusively determine an absorption redshift.

We acknowledge excellent support from the Gemini South staff.

Observations started on 2025 Apr 24.322 UT (0.87 hr after the Swift/BAT trigger) and consisted of a sequence of increasing exposure times (175, 300, 600, 1200, 1920 s).

In the acquisition image (taken at a mid time of 0.851 hr after the Swift/BAT trigger), the counterpart is well detected with a magnitude r = 19.09 +- 0.02, calibrated against nearby stars from the SkyMapper catalog (Wolf et al. 2018, doi:10.4225/41/593620ad5b574).

We detect a bright continuum over the wavelength range 3100 to 24,500 AA. Many absorption features are visible which we interpret as Mn II, Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, Ti II, Ca II, Na I, including a number of fine-structure transitions from Fe II*, all at a common redshift z = 0.310. At a consistent redshift, we also detect several emission lines, due to [O II], [O III], [S II], [N II], and the Balmer lines from the GRB host galaxy (Perez-Fournon et al., GCN 40227). We note that our redshift is consistent with the photometric determination z = 0.33 +/- 0.12 of the host redshift from the Legacy Survey (Zhou et al. 2021, doi:10.1093/mnras/staa3764).

We observed the optical counterpart (Perez-Garcia et al., GCN 40259; Liu et al., GCN 40260; Becerra et al., GCN 40261; Brivio et al., GCN 40264) of EP250427a / GRB 250427A (Wang et al., GCN 40257; Ravasio et al., GCN 40262) using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-21,000 AA, and consist of 2 exposures of 600 s each. The observation mid time was 2025 Apr 27.394 UT (5.80 hr after the GRB).

In a 30-s image taken in the r band at a mid time of 5.61 hr after the trigger, we measure a magnitude r = 18.40 +- 0.02 AB, calibrated against nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog.

In a preliminary reduction of the spectra, we clearly observe a bright continuum over the entire covered wavelength range, detected at high S/N. The sightline is rich with intervening absorption systems, in particular C IV absorbers (1548,1550 doublet) are detected at z = 1.146, 1.222, 1.231, 1.405, 1.407, 1.518, and 1.520.

The highest-redshift system is only securely detected in C IV and Si IV (at both z = 1.518 and 1.520). There is a possible indication of Lyman alpha absorption at the very blue end of the spectrum, with very low column density (much less than a DLA). The system at z = 1.405/1.407 is on the other hand the strongest and has detection in many species at both high and low ionization, including Si II, C II, Si IV, C IV, Fe II, Al II, Al III, Mg II and Mg I, as well as a rich velocity structure. No emission lines are visible at any of the above mentioned redshifts.

Our data are therefore in good agreement with the results and the redshift value z = 1.520 already reported by Chornock et al. (GCN 40265) using the Keck telescope.

We have triangulated this burst to the 3sigma
confidence error box:

ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 148.738 69.564
---------------------------------------

The area of the error box is 120 sq. arcmin.

The error box is consistent with a source in M81.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst had a duration of 0.17 sec,
fluence 2.34(-0.28, +0.31)10^-5 erg/cm2,
and peak flux on 2ms time scale 1.89 (-0.35, +0.25)10^-3 erg/cm2/sec
(both in 20 keV - 10 MeV range).
The Epeak of the time-integrated spectrum is 1920 +/- 400 keV.
Assuming this burst originated from a source in M81 (D = 4 Mpc),
the isotrpoic energy release of this GRB is ~4.5x10^46 erg,
which consistent with the energy release of
27 December giant flare from SGR 1806-20.

The peak flux of this GRB is the largest ever observed for
the Konus-Wind short GRBs.

The burst light curve had a very steep rise ~4 msec and a decaying tail,
similar to the initial pulses of SGR giant flares.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

A preliminary analysis of the WXM and FREGATE spectral data for GRB

times exponential model with best-fit parameters 

alpha = -0.46 +/- 0.07
E_peak = 120 +/- 7 keV.

Thus the spectrum of the burst is very hard, as expected for a 
short/hard GRB.

The preliminary spectral analysis gives fluences for the burst of 0.66
x 10-6 erg cm-2 in the 2-30 keV energy band, 4.3 x 10-6 erg cm-2 in the
30-400 keV energy band, and 4.9 x 10-6 erg cm-2 in the 2-400 keV energy
band.  The burst is thus quite bright, given that its T90 duration is
about 2 seconds.

The latter line is located on the edge of the atmospheric A-band and and
its reality is therefore questionable.  We find three possible
interpretations for the redshift:

[1] The broad line is the (barely resolved) [OII] 3727 doublet at z=1.099.  
In this case there is no obvious interpretation for the second line.

[2] The broad line is H-alpha and the weak line line is [OI] 6364 at
z=0.193.  In this case we may expect to detect the [NII] and [SII]
doublets, which we do not.

[3] The broad line is [OIII] 5007 and the weak line is H-beta at z=0.562.  
In this case we expect to detect [OIII] 4959, which we do not.

Given that the weak line may not be real, and the lack of detection of
various other lines expected in scenarios [2] and [3], we favor the first
interpretation and a redshift z=1.099.

We note that spectra with bluer coverage may be able to confirm or rule
out options [2] and [3] through the detection (or lack thereof) of [OII],

inspection of the VLT-FORS2 spectrum of GRB060218/SN2006aj taken on 21 Feb 
2006 (Masetti et al. 2006, GCN 4803), i.e. ~3 days after the GRB event, 
indicates that the observed features are similar to those of the energetic 
type Ic SN 2002ap at a comparable epoch (Mazzali et al. 2002, Ap. J. 572, 
L21, Fig. 2). In particular, broad absorptions near 4800 Ang and 5800 Ang 
can be identified as due to FeII and SiII lines, respectively. This 
suggests that the SN and the GRB occurred within ~1 day of one another.

The observed luminosity of the optical counterpart of GRB060218 is larger 
than that of SN2002ap at the same epoch, and is consistent with the 
luminosity of SN1998bw.

If an afterglow is still present, we estimate that it does not contribute 
for more than 25% of the total flux. If it has a power-law shape, this is 
not bluer than nu^{-2}.

Although spectroscopy of SN1998bw did not begin until day 8 (Galama et al. 
1998, Nature 395, 670), and therefore a direct comparison is not yet 
possible, it is likely that SN2006aj will evolve to resemble SN1998bw.",0.168,GRB060218/SN2006aj,VLT-FORS2,Spectroscopic,0.168

report:


ESO's VLT-Kueyen (UT 2) observed SN 2006aj (GRB 060218) around the
time of maximum light on March 3/4, 2006. Observations were performed
using the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) at a
spectral resolution of 46 000. The signal-to-noise ratio of the
spectrum (2100 sec exposure time) is about 30 per resolution element,
which is sufficient to measure the equivalent width (EW) of the Na I D
lines along the line of sight.

For the Na I D2 component (lambda 5889.95) produced in our Galaxy we
find EW = (0.321 +/- 0.008) Angstrom. Using the empirical relation
between the equivalent width of the 5889.95 line and the interstellar
reddening (Munari & Zwitter A&A 318, 269, 1997), this corresponds to
a Galactic reddening of E(B-V) = (0.127 +/- 0.005) mag. Assuming a
ratio of total-to-selective extinction of R_V = 3.1, we obtain a
Galactic visual extinction along the line of sight of A_V = (0.39 +/-
0.02) mag. This is slightly less than what follows from the COBE
maps (Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis 1998).

In the GRB host galaxy we identify two redshift systems at a
heliocentric velocity of 10008.1 km/s and 10032.3 km/s (Na I D2) with
the following equivalent widths in the observer frame: system I:
EW(D2) = (0.084 +/- 0.008) Angstrom, system II: EW(D2) = (0.072 +/-
0.008) Angstrom. Assuming that the aforementioned empirical relation
is also representative for the interstellar medium in the GRB host
galaxy, and correcting EW for a factor of 1/(1+z) for the host frame, we
arrive at a combined reddening of E(B-V) = (0.042 +/- 0.003) mag. If
again R_V = 3.1, we obtain a host extinction along the line of sight
of A_V = (0.13 +/- 0.01) mag.

We finally note that the tiny error bars should not be overinterpreted.
They just include the measurement errors but not the systematic error
of the method itself, which we cannot quantify.

We thank the ESO staff, in particular Dominique Naef, for performing
the observations and Alain Smette, ESO, for valuable comments.

- An interactive program to compute pseudo-redshifts. 
  This program requires the measure of the GRB spectral parameters,

""We obtained 2x600 sec spectra of GRB 060218 / SN 2006aj
(GCN 4775) on 20060726 UT, 153 rest-frame days past the
GRB trigger, with Keck I (+ LRIS).  The spectrum shows
prominent nebular emission lines attributed to [O I]
6300, 6364, Na D, and the Ca II IR triplet.  The spectrum
resembles the nebular spectrum of GRB 980425 / SN 1998bw
at a similar epoch.  With a redshift of z = 0.033
(Mirabal & Halpern, GCN 4792), this is the most distant
GRB-SN with a observed nebular spectrum.

The [O I] line has a velocity width of 10700 km/s, which
is quantitatively similar to SN 1998bw 157 rest-frame
days past the GRB trigger.  The line has one strong peak,
with a slight shoulder, attributed to [O I] 6364.  There
is no obvious asymmetry in this spectrum, consistent with
the models of Mazzali et al. (2005, Science, 308, 1284).
Further spectroscopic observations are encouraged.

On the night of 2006 July 25 (UT), we imaged the field of GRB051109B 
(GCN 4222) for 630 seconds in g' and 600 seconds in R using Keck I (+ 
LRIS).  There is a bright (R ~ 14.5) spiral galaxy close to the XRT 
position (GCN 4226), also visible in DSS and other surveys.  In our 
imaging, the galaxy is observed to be a barred spiral of type SBa.  The 
presence of a faint tidal bridge indicates that the galaxy has recently 
interacted with a neighboring galaxy 60"" to the north.

Using 25 X-ray sources and 51 DSS sources in the field, we calculate an 
improved XRT position of RA = 23:01:50.21, dec = +38:40:46.0 (with a 90% 
uncertainty radius of 2.2"", including an estimate of the systematic 
error.)  This position lies inside an outer spiral arm of the galaxy, 
identifying it as the GRB host.  In addition, both our position and the 
original XRT error circle include a faint optical point-like source at 
RA = 23:01:50.30, dec = +38:40:46.7 (0.5"" uncertainty).

We obtained spectroscopy of the host galaxy and optical source the 
following night.  The galaxy is observed to be at a redshift of z = 
0.080, and lacks any strong emission features.  Spectroscopy of the 
point source inside the XRT error circle shows no evidence for a 
nebular-phase supernova; however, there are emission lines indicating 
active star formation in this region.

The offset of the position of the optical source to the galaxy center is 
14.1"", or 20.9 kpc at the observed redshift.  This is the largest offset 
yet seen in a long GRB in angular or physical scale.  Using the 15-150 
keV gamma-ray fluence (GCN 4237), E_iso for this GRB is 4.1 x 10^48 
ergs, comparable to that observed for GRB980425 but less than that of 
any other GRB.  GRB980425/SN1998bw was also seen in a spiral galaxy at 
large offset, and also lacked a detected optical afterglow.

Given the low redshift of this system, inspection of archival images for 
the presence or absence of supernova emission is strongly encouraged. 
We also encourage radio and X-ray observations to look for a late-time 
afterglow or supernova.

Using FORS1 on the Very Large Telescope, we obtained 
2*20 min spectra (grism 300V+GG375 covering 4000-8000 A) 
of the GRB 060602A host galaxy on 28 December 2006. A firm 
upper limit of z < 2.3 can be placed on the host redshift 
from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in the combined 
spectrum.

We do detect a strong emission line at 6664 A. If it 
corresponds to H-alpha at z = 0.015, we would expect to 
detect H-beta and the [O III] doublet in our spectrum. 
However, no features are visible at their predicted 
locations. In addition, this redshift would imply a very 
faint absolute magnitude of M_R = -10.3.

If the emission line corresponds to [O III] 5008 at 
z = 0.331, we would expect to detect [O II] 3728 which we 
do not. The most probable association is with [O II] 3728, 
corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.787. 

Using the relations by Kennicutt (1998, ARA&A, 36, 189), 
the flux of the proposed [O II] line corresponds to a star 
formation rate (SFR) of approximately 1.9 M_Sun/year. This 
value has not been corrected for host extinction, and is 
therefore a strict lower limit to the actual SFR. The 
specific SFR is around 13.6 M_Sun/year (L/L*)^-1, typical 
for GRB host galaxies (Christensen et al., 2004, A&A, 425, 913).",z = 0.787,GRB 060602A,Very Large Telescope (VLT),Spectroscopic,0.787

We observed the field of GRB 071117 (Ukwatta et al., GCN 7098) with the 
ESO VLT, starting on 2007 Nov 18.005 UT (9.28 hr after the GRB). We 
clearly detect the two sources indicated by Bloom (GCNs 7105, 7110), 
including the afterglow s2. Source s1 appears extended in our images, 
while source s2 is indeed pointlike (seeing 0.85""). A faint nebulosity 
is apparent surrounding both objects.

A VLT spectrum was obtained with the FORS1 instrument starting on 2007 
Nov 18.03 UT, placing both sources on the slit. Three exposures of 30 
min each were secured. The afterglow spectrum shows a faint, blue 
continuum between 3700 to 9000 A, and a weak emission line is apparent 
at 8688 A. Interpreting this as [OII], we infer a redshift of z=1.331, 
which we consider as the likely redshift of the GRB. Interpreting the 
observed line as [OIII] or Halpha, we would expect to detect [OII] at 
6466 or 4934 A, respectively, which we do not see. A more conservative 
upper limit to the GRB redshift comes from the nondetection of any 
dropout in the blue down to 3800 A, which implies z < 2.1.

C. Thoene (DARK) report:

On the night of 2007-07-18 we re-observed the field of GRB 070429B (GCN 
6358, Markwardt et al.), likely to be a short-hard burst (T90 = 0.5 +- 
0.1 s, GCN 6365, Tueller et al.) under photometric conditions using the 
Keck I telescope + LRIS, in g and R filters simultaneously for a total 
integration of 930s(g) / 840s(R) under relatively poor seeing.  We 
further imaged the field using GMOS on Gemini-South on 2007-11-27 for 
1200s in r filter under excellent seeing.

The bright source reported by Cucchiara et al. (GCN 6368), designated 
object ""A"" by Antonelli et al. (GCN 6372) and likely the host galaxy of 
the GRB, is well-detected in R and r and weakly detected in g.  Using 
Landolt standard stars we measure an aperture magnitude for this object 
(in a 2.1"" radius aperture) of

g = 24.79 +/- 0.14
R = 23.24 +/- 0.05

This is consistent within errors with the magnitudes reported by 
Cucchiara et al. and Antonelli et al. 4 and 5 hours after the burst, 
respectively.  Image subtraction of the new Gemini imaging versus the 
earlier epoch (GCN 6368) reveals no variability to a limiting magnitude 
of R > 24.5, ruling out an afterglow contribution in the first epoch 
(4.84 hours after the burst) at this level.

Object ""B"" is also detected in both filters, and also shows no evidence 
for variability.


On the night of 2007-10-09 we performed longslit spectroscopy covering 
both targets (""A"" and ""B"") in two integrations of 1500s each, using Keck 
I + LRIS.

The trace of object ""A"" is faint and the spectrum is mostly featureless, 
but a faint line signature is observed centered at 7098 Angstroms, with 
a FWHM of 6 Angstroms.  The feature appears present in both exposures, 
though this site is severely affected by a cosmic ray in one exposure. 
We identify this feature as most likely being the [OII]3727 doublet. 
Other line identifications (H-alpha, H-beta, or [OIII]) are disfavored 
due to the absence of corroborating lines that would be expected over 
our spectral range (3500-8900 Angstroms) in those cases.

Association of this feature with [OII] indicates a redshift for this 
object of z=0.904.  Calibrating relative to R-band photometry, we 
estimate a preliminary line flux of 3e-17 erg/s/cm^2, corresponding to 
an unextincted star formation rate (Kewley et al. 2002) of 0.7 M_sun/yr, 
comparable to that observed in previous short burst hosts.  We note also 
the red color of this galaxy.

I have applied our time-dependent pileup correction code (Butler &
Kocevski 2007; ApJ, 663, 407) to the XRT spectrum of GRB080319B (see, Racusin
et al., GCN 7459).  Although I find similar temporal properties in the     
afterglow decay to those quoted by the XRT team, I find significantly
different spectral properties.  Notably, there is no significant evidence
for a time-variation in N_H and no significant need for a thermal component.
The WT model (0.4-10 keV) and PC mode (0.3-10 keV) spectra fitted jointly
and well (chi^2/nu=799.70/788) with an absorbed powerlaw yields:

Gamma = 1.84+/-0.01
N_H = 1.7+/-0.1 x 10^21 cm^(-2) @ z=0.937 (Vreeswijk et al., GCN 7451), in 
  addition to the expected Galaxy contribution along the line of sight.  Here 
  we assume the solar chemical abundances from Anders & Ebihara (1982).
  This value of N_H implies ~2 mag extinction in the observer frame V band
  assuming the mean Galactic dust+gas properties.

Allowing the photon indices to vary separately: Gamma1=1.84^{+0.1}_{-0.2} and 
Gamma2=1.85+/-0.05, closely consistent.  The fractional possible increase in 
rest-frame N_H between the WT mode data (t=660s to 4.95 ksec) and the PC mode 
data (t=4.95 to 174 ksec) is modest and weakly significant: 
0.74^{+0.43}_{-0.37}%.  I suspect the indicated variations are purely due to 
calibration uncertainties in the WT mode data.  The hard WT mode spectral fit 
in GCN 7459 can be reproduced by relaxing our pileup correction.

Additional evidence disfavors an interpretation of an evolving X-ray
spectrum:

Time resolved fits to the WT mode data show no significant evidence for
spectral evolution in the WT mode data considered alone. See,
http://astro.berkeley.edu/~nat/080319B_spec.jpg

The light curve is a simple (broken) powerlaw for the WT mode data, with
no flaring.  Afterglows with such light curves typically exhibit weak
or no spectral evolution (e.g., Butler & Kocevski 2007, ApJ, 668, 400).
There is no significant variations in the X-ray hardness ratio for this event.
See, http://astro.berkeley.edu/~nat/080319B_hardness.jpg

A fit to BAT data (see also, Cummings et al., GCN 7462) in a time     
region (58s to 303s; chi^2/nu=36.46/55) overlapping the XRT observation has
a roughly consistent powerlaw (Gamma=2.1+/-0.1), and also allows for a
smooth extrapolation in flux between BAT and XRT assuming a simple powerlaw
model connecting the flux in both instruments.

Given the very strong absorption lines reported in our spectroscopic

host galaxy of this burst, as suggested by Rumyantsev et al.  However, 
the sources above are offset significantly from the afterglow (which 
itself is not obviously extended), suggesting instead that they may 
represent one or both of the intervening absorbers.

Later the same night, we acquired 2x900s spectra using a slit covering 
the northern (afterglow) source and southern source, and an additional 
1x600 spectrum using a slit covering the faint western source and the 
bright, clearly separated eastern source noted by Kann et al. (GCN 
7822).  No obvious emission lines are evident in any spectrum.  At any 
of the host and absorber redshifts of z=1.688, z=1.563 and z=1.271 
respectively, the bright potential emission features (Ly-alpha, OII) are 
expected to fall outside our wavelength coverage, on top of sky lines, 
or be strongly attenuated by the atmosphere, so this result is mildly 
supportive of an association of these sources with the host and/or 
absorbers.  However, the integrations were relatively short, and further 
follow-up is warranted.",1.688,GRB 080603A,Keck I / LRIS,Spectroscopic,1.688

Brewer, D. Starr, and R. Kennedy (UC Berkeley) report:

GRB 070809 was a short-hard burst (Barthelmy et al., GCN 6788) detected 
by Swift.  In our observations on 2007-08-10 and 2007-08-11 we detected 
a very faint optical afterglow candidate and presented evidence (at 
about the 3-sigma level) for fading between the two nights.  (GCNs 6739, 
GCN 6774).

On the night of 2008-02-10, we re-imaged the field using Keck I (+LRIS), 
again in R and g filters simultaneously, for a combined 2550s (R) and 
2820s (g).  We unambiguously confirm the fading behavior of the optical 
transient, with no detection in either filter to R > 25.0, g > 26.3.  We 
rule out the presence of a host galaxy coincident with the transient 
location to the same level.  (An color image of the field is posted to 
http://lyra.berkeley.edu/~dperley/070809/070809host.png.  A comparison 
between the early- and late-time imaging is available at 
http://lyra.berkeley.edu/~dperley/070809/070809compare.png)

Several other short bursts with no strictly coincident host galaxy have 
been found to be close in physical projection to relatively low-redshift 
galaxies (e.g. Bloom et al. 2006, 2007, Stratta et al. 2007, Troja et 
al. 2008).  This burst is not an exception, with an edge-on spiral 
galaxy centered at an offset of 5.6"" to the northwest.  Photometry of 
this source gives magnitudes of R = 21.7 +/- 0.3, g = 22.7 +/- 0.2 (the 
relatively large uncertainties are due to the extended nature of the 
source and the variable background due to the presence of a nearby 
bright star).

On the night of 2008-06-07 we obtained 2x900s of spectroscopy of this 
source using Keck I (+LRIS), with a PA aligned with the orientation of 
the galaxy.  The galaxy is well contained within the 1 arcsec slit.  Two 
relatively bright emission lines are detected - one at 4542.0 A and one 
at 6100.1 A.  Associating these lines with [O II] and [O III], 
respectively, the redshift of this galaxy is z=0.2187.  No other 
emission lines are significantly detected.

The line flux of the [O II] doublet is ~2 x 10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 
(correcting for Galactic extinction of E(B-V) = 0.09), corresponding to 
an uncorrected star formation rate (Kewley et al. 2002) of ~0.15 
M_sun/year.  As the galaxy is edge-on this is likely to be well below 
the actual value.  The velocity dispersion of the galaxy along the slit 
axis is 110 +/- 20 km/s, which over the observed radius of 1.8"" (=6.3 
kpc) gives a mass of 1.8 x 10^10 M_sun.  These values suggest a 
relatively small spiral galaxy.

While this galaxy is not particularly massive or luminous, the close 
proximity (20 kpc in projection at z=0.2187) and lack of a coincident 
host is strongly suggestive of association given previous short bursts. 
  However, we issue several caveats:

- Some short bursts have been shown to have secure hosts at z~1 (e.g. 
060801, 070429B and 070714B:  Berger et al. 2007, GCN 6836, GCN7140, 
Cenko et al. 2008.; see Berger 2008 for a review), and our limiting 
magnitudes do not rule out relatively underluminous galaxies at this 
redshift.

- One other probable galaxy is present somewhat closer to the afterglow, 
a very faint (R = 24.6, g = 25.7) source 2.3"" away from the OT position. 
  The probability of chance association of the afterglow position with 
this source (if it is a galaxy) based on galaxy count/offset statistics 
is higher than the probability of association with the spiral (~10% vs. 
~5%), though they are comparable.  The source is at unknown redshift.

- It is possible (but unlikely, GCN 6788) that this event is not a short 
burst, in which case a even higher-redshift origin would not be surprising.

At a redshift of z=0.2187, the isotropic energy release for this burst 
would be E_iso = 1.1 * 10^49 erg in the observed 15-150 keV band.

ESO VLT equipped with FORS1.

Inside the XRT error circle, we detect the object first reported by 
Clemens et al. (GCN 7948) in the R and I bands. The source had R ~ 19.6 
on 2008 Jul 7.385 UT (47 min after the trigger), calibrated against 
USNO-B1. This object is not visible in the DSS (which reaches a deeper 
limit) and seems brighter than in the later observation reported by 
Clemens et al. (GCN 7948). It is thus very likely the optical afterglow 
of GRB 080707. A finding chart is posted at

Since telescope pointing constraints did not allow a prompt observation of

(Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405), mounted at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope

on Jul 27, 23:08 UT, nearly 15 hrs after the burst. Under mediocre conditions
a total of 90 min effective exposure in g'r'i'z' and 76 min in JHK was
collected. Correcting for foreground extinction of A_V = 6.15 (Schlegel et al.
1998), we measure the following AB magnitudes/limits:

The corresponding SED is well fit by a single power law with slope 0.85, 
with no evidence of additional (intrinsic) extinction, and with the 
i'-limit being consistent with that power law. Our SED power law has an 
extinction-corrected R-H=1.0. The best fit Hyper-z redshift to our data 
gives z=5.5-6.5, with a firm upper limit of 6.7. Given the non-constraining 
upper limits at i' and bluer, no lower limit can be placed. If the color

different grism choices, beginning on 2008 Sep 6.053  UT (8.34 hr after 
the GRB), and covering the wavelength ranges 3800-9500 AA at low to 
moderate resolution.

In the acquisition images, we clearly detect a point source inside the 
refined XRT error circle (Osborne et al., GCN 8189), at the coordinates 
(J2000):

RA = 20:06:57.90
Dec = -62:33:46.8

This position is consistent with that of the UVOT candidate afterglow 
reported by Stroh et al. (GCN 8182), the object being now significantly 
fainter (R ~ 20.2). We note that this position is 3.8"" off the center of 
the bright 2MASS galaxy 2MASX J20065732-6233465, also visible in the DSS

Spectroscopy of the afterglow reveals resonance absorption features from 
several ions, including OI, SiII, CIV, FeII, AlII, AlIII, MgII, MgI, at 
a redshift z = 2.374. The detection of transitions from fine-structure 
levels of FeII indicates that this is the redshift of the GRB, under the

The afterglow of GRB 080928 detected by Swift (Sakamoto et al., GCN
8292, see also Rykoff et al., GCN 8293) was observed with FORS2
mounted on the Antu telescope of ESO's VLT on Cerro Paranal, Chile.
Following an acquisition image, which was started at 6:31 UT on
September 29, 2008 (15.5 hr after the GRB trigger), a single 1800 s
spectrum was secured. It was taken with a 1"" slit and the 300V grism,
resulting in an approximate resolution of 11 A, and a useful
wavelength coverage of 3800-9300 A. From the 60 s acquisition image,
we measure an afterglow magnitude of R = 20.4 based on USNO-B1
magnitudes.

The extracted spectrum shows a multitude of significant absorption
lines, which we identify with common resonance lines of mainly MgII
and FeII, originating in at least two absorption systems at z=0.735
and z=1.692. The latter redshift presumably corresponds to that of the
GRB host galaxy. We do not find evidence for a spectral break due to
the Lyman alpha forest down to 3800 A, setting a firm upper limit on
the GRB redshift of z < 2.1. These results are consistent with the
redshift limits set by GROND (Rossi et al., GCN 8296) and UVOT (Kuin
et al., GCN 8298), but not with the value of z=2.49 reported by
Cucchiara et al. (GCN 8300).

The equivalent width of the MgII 2796 line of the z=0.735 system
(EW_rest ~ 4.3 A) is much larger than that of the z=1.692 system. We
note the presence of an R ~ 22 object, not covered by the slit, at
2.6"" NNE of the afterglow position, which could possibly be a bright
host galaxy, or the counterpart of the z=0.735 absorber. The slit
serendipitously covers a galaxy 30"" away from the afterglow (at
R.A. 06:20:13.35, decl. -55:11:55.0), which shows an apparent emission
line at 6470 A; this can be identified as [OII] 3727 at a redshift of
z=0.736. At this redshift, 2.6 and 30"" correspond to projected
distances of 19 and 219 kpc, respectively.

The spectrum from T0+3.1s to T0+29.7s is best fit by a Band function 
with indices alpha=-0.93 +/- 0.02 and beta=-2.2 +/- 0.1, and peak energy 
of Epeak=653 +/- 45 keV (chi squared 365 for 311 d.o.f.). At a redshift 
of 0.736 (GCN 9053), the Epeak in the GRB rest frame, Epeak_rest, is 
1133 +/- 0.078 MeV.

The event fluence in this time interval is (8.09 +/- 0.10)E-5 erg/cm^2 
in the 8-1000 keV band and (9.5 +/- 1.0)E-5 erg/cm^2 in the 8keV-40MeV 
band. Using standard cosmology (Omega_matter = 0.27, Omega_lambda = 
0.73, H0=71) the isotropic equivalent energy in the 8keV-40MeV band is 
E_iso = (2.3 +/- 0.2)E+53 ergs. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0+23.5 s in the 8-1000 keV band is 18.5 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

This time interval consists of three main emission peaks, from T0+3.1s 
to T0+8.2s, from T0+13.3s to T0+19.5s, and from T0+23.6 to T0+25.6s. All 
of these shorter intervals are also best fit by a Band function. For the 
first interval the power-law indices are alpha=-0.79 +/- 0.04 and 
beta=-2.3 +/- 0.2, Epeak is 648 +/- 68 keV, Epeak_rest is 1125 +/- 118

We performed the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis
of GRB 090418A (Swift/BAT trigger #349510: Mangano et al., GCN Circ. 
9149, Fenimore et al. GCN Circ. 9157).
Since the Konus-Wind observed this GRB in the waiting mode, we only
have 3 channel spectral data for the Konus-Wind which cover the energy
range from 20 keV to 1.2 MeV.  Therefore, the joint spectral analysis of
the Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT data enables to derive the broad-band
spectral parameters of this burst.

The time interval of the spectral data for each instrument is chosen
from  T0(BAT)-6.7 to T0(BAT)+58.1 sec where T0(BAT) is the trigger time
of BAT at 11:07:40.2 UTC.  The energy ranges which we used in the joint
spectral analysis are 20-1200 keV and 14-150 keV for the Konus-Wind and
the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of two instruments are
fitted with the spectral model multiplied by the constant factor to take
into account the systematic effective area uncertainties in the response
matrices of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law with exponential cutoff 
model: dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). The constant factors 
of each instrument agree within 20%.  No systematic residual from the 
best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  The 
best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = -1.30 +/- 0.09 and Epeak = 
610(-164, +530) keV (chi2/dof = 37.0/57).  The best fit spectral 
parameters for the GRB (Band) model fixing beta = -2.5 are: alpha = -1.30 
+/- 0.09, and Epeak = 601(-215, +554) keV (chi2/dof = 37.1/57).  The 
energy fluence in the 15-1200 keV band calculated by a power-law with 
exponential cutoff model for this 64.8 sec interval is (1.79 +/- 
0.21)x10^-5 erg/cm2.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

et al.,  GCN 9336) using  VLT/FORS2 (PI McBreen). Observations  of the
optical source  consistent with position of the  afterglow (Marshall &
Hoversten, GCN 9332;  Olofsson et al., GCN 9338;  Olivares et al., GCN
9352) started  on May  12 08:17UT.  A  total of three  30min exposures
with the 300I grism  were obtained, covering an approximate wavelength
range of 6000-10000 Angstroms.

Preliminary analysis of the spectra reveals two emission lines at 7093
and 9250 Angstroms,  which we identify as [OII] and  Hbeta at a common
redshift of z=0.903 +/- 0.003. Furthermore, there are indications of a
spectral break  in the continuum  around 7600 Angstroms,  suggesting a
possible 4000A break at the same redshift.

The detection of  emission lines and the possible  4000A break suggest
the dominance of the underlying  host galaxy over the afterglow at the
time of our observations. It also confirms that host galaxies of short
GRBs are not  all old and dead ellipticals but  instead drawn from the
underlying  field galaxy  distribution (e.g.,  Berger 2009,  ApJ, 690,
231).

In the  acquisition image the center  of the host is  0.7"" offset with
respect to the NOT refined afterglow position, which corresponds to 5.5 
kpc at a
z=0.903.

At a redshift of z=0.903, the isotropic equivalent energy of the burst
is  3.8E52 erg in the 1 keV - 10 MeV rest  frame (using  the Fermi/GBM
spectral parameters of Guiriec et  al., GCN 9336).  The peak energy of
the best fit  GBM Band function model  is 8.4 +/- 0.8 MeV  in the rest
frame.

We have observed the afterglow of GRB 090812 (Stamatikos et al.
GCNC 9768) using FORS2 at the VLT (Paranal observatory) starting
at 06:54 UT (52min after the burst). In the spectrum we detect strong
absorption lines, including Ly-alpha, SiII, SiII*, CII, SiIV, CIV,  
SiII, AlII,
AlIII, FeII, ZnII, MnII and TiII at a common redshift of 2.452 which we
identify as the redshift of the GRB. We also detect absorption lines  
from an
unidentified intervening system. Further analysis is ongoing.

The most intense pulse of the long GRB 090812 (Swift/BAT trigger
#359711: Stamatikos et al., GCN Circ. 9768, Baumgartner et al. GCN Circ. 
9775) triggered Konus-Wind at T0(KW)=21758.942 s UT (06:02:38.942).
Since the Konus-Wind trigger record misses the early weaker part of this 
GRB, we have only Konus-Wind 3-channel spectral data for the whole burst 
which cover the energy range from 23 keV to 1.4 MeV.
We performed the Konus-Wind and Swift/BAT joint spectral analysis of
this GRB to derive the broad-band spectral and energetic parameters of
this burst.

The time interval of the spectral data is chosen from
T0(BAT)-6.7 to T0(BAT)+58.1 sec where T0(BAT) is the trigger time
of BAT at 06:02:08.897 UTC.  The energy ranges which we used in the
joint spectral analysis are 23-1400 keV and 15-150 keV for the
Konus-Wind and the Swift/BAT respectively.  The spectral data of two
instruments are fitted with the spectral model multiplied by the
constant factor to take into account the systematic effective area
uncertainties in the response matrices of each instrument.

The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law with exponential cutoff
model: dN/dE ~ E^{alpha}*exp(-(2+alpha)*E/Epeak). The constant factors
of each instrument agree within 15%.  No systematic residual from the
best fit model is seen in the spectral data of each instrument.  The
best fit spectral parameters are: alpha = -1.03(-0.06, +0.07) and Epeak
= 586(-152, +243) keV (chi2/dof = 59.3/57).  The best fit spectral
parameters for the GRB (Band) model fixing beta = -2.5 are:
alpha = -1.03 +/- 0.07, and Epeak = 572(-159, +251) keV (chi2/dof = 
59.6/57). The energy fluence in the 15-1400 keV band calculated by a 
power-law with exponential cutoff model for this 64.8 sec interval is 
(2.61 +/- 0.34)x10^-5 erg/cm2 (assuming the constant factor of the 
Konus-Wind is fixed to 1).

Assuming z = 2.452 (de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN Circ. 9771) and a
standard cosmology model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27,
Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the isotropic energy release is E_iso = 4.4 (-0.6,
+0.7)x10^53 erg in 1 keV to 10 MeV at the GRB rest frame extrapolating
the best Band function fit fixing beta = -2.5, and the rest frame peak 
energy is Epeak_rest = 2.0(-0.5, +0.9) MeV.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

""On 2009 September 3.27 UT we observed the Fermi/LAT GRB 090902B
(Bissaldi et al., GCN 9866, de Palma 9867) with the Gemini-N
telescope equipped with the GMOS spectrograph.

A single object has been found at the position of the Swift/XRT
afterglow (Kennea et al. GCN 9868, Perley et al., GCN 9870) in
our acquisition image.

A pair of 900 sec exposures spectra were obtained with a wavelength
coverage of 4500-7500A under good conditions.
The spectrum reveals a series of metal absorption features,
MgII[2796,2803], MgI[2853],MnII[2606], FeII[2600], MnII[2594],
FeII[2586], FeII[2260], SiII[1808], SiII*[1816].

All these features are consistent with a redshift of z = 1.822,
which, therefore, we conclude is the redshift of GRB 090902B.

the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO-VLT UT2. Observations were 
taken as part of the instrument Science Verification phase. X-shooter is 
a broad-band single-object spectrograph covering the wavelength range 
from the UV to the infrared (3300-22000 AA).

At the beginning of the observation (22.0 hr after the GRB), the 
afterglow had R = 17.9 as measured from the acquisition image. Four 
spectra lasting 1800 s each were secured.

The spectrum has high signal to noise and shows a wealth of absorption 
features, together with a broad depression around 3780 AA, which we 
interpret as a DLA. We identify CIV 1548 and 1550, Si II 1304 and 1526, 
SiII* 1533, FeII 1608, MgII 2798 and 2803, and several others, from

We observed the position of the afterglow of GRB 120224A (Saxton et al.,
GCN 12980) using the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the VLT.
Observations started on 00:30 UT on 25 February 2012, i.e. 19.83 hours
after burst.
In the acquisition images, 5 x 150 seconds in R filter, we find a faint
source, consistent with the candidate afterglow reported by Elliott et al
(GCN 12988). We find a preliminary magnitude of R=22.3 using the USNO-B
star 0722-0043411 (R=16.65). The detection of the afterglow in the R band
places a limit on the redshift of approximately z < 5.

We performed spectroscopy of this source, under poor seeing and high
airmass. We detect a faint continuum in the near-infrared arm over the
whole wavelength range, at low signal to noise.
In the visual arm data we detect a very faint continuum at the red end of
the wavelength range. No emission lines are detected. Because of the low
signal to noise we are not able to identify absorption features. The non-
detection of continuum emission below ~600 nm may be indicative of a
moderately high redshift for this burst, though alternatives, such as a
reddened spectrum (note that the X-ray afterglow shows considerable
absorption; Osborne et al. GCN 12986), can not be excluded at present.

We observed the field of GRB120401A (Swift trigger 519043; Beardmore et al., GCN #13182) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chile).

First observations started at 23:32 UT on 2012-04-01, 18.1 hours after the GRB trigger. For an exposure time of 18.76 min in g'r'i'z' and 15 min in JHK performed at an average seeing of 1"".8 and at an average airmass of 2.1, we find a single point source within the 1"".6 enhanced Swift-XRT error circle reported by Evans et al. (GCN #13184) at

Dec. (J2000.0) = -17:38:08.5 = -17.63569

We estimate preliminary magnitudes (all in AB) of

r' = 22.7 +/- 0.2
i' = 21.5 +/- 0.1
z' = 21.0 +/- 0.1
J  = 20.7 +/- 0.2,
H  > 20.7, and
K  > 18.5

The SED, constructed from the Galactic foreground extinction (E_(B-V)=0.053 mag, Schlegel et al. 1998) corrected magnitudes of the object gives a photometric redshift of z=4.5  0.5, while intrinsic or host galaxy extinction alone cannot account for the r'-i' colour. 

A second observation began at 23:29 UT on 2012-04-02, 1.75 days after the GRB trigger. Due to telescope pointing problems, JHK were the only filters to cover the GRB location. For an exposure time of 38.3 min in JHK at an average seeing of 1"".4 and at an average airmass of 2.0, we do not detect the source. With an upper limit of J (AB) > 21.4, it suggests a decay of at least 0.7 mag.

""On March 27.25 UT we observed the field of GRB 130327A 
(Ukwatta et al., GCN 14331) with the Gemini-North telescope
equipped with the GMOS camera.

We obtained a 4 minutes i' band image of the field:
the two sources identified by Butler et al. (GCN 14334)
are both detected.

The southern source (#1) is located at
RA: 06:08:09.12 (J2000)
Dec: +55:42:47.98 (J2000)

The northern source (#2) is located inside the XRT revised 
error circle (Osborne et al. GCN 14335) at:

RA: 06:08:09.25 (J2000)
Dec: +55:42:54.39  (J2000)

Using several nearby USNO-B1 stars we estimated i' = 19.81 
+- 0.02, (source #1), and i' = 21.75 +- 0.06 (source #2), 
which is 0.43 mag fainter than the RATIR observations. 

We also obtained a 2x900s spectra of these two sources under cloudy
conditions, covering the 6000-10000A wavelength range: source #1
presents several stellar features, while source #2 presents a noisy 
continuum, but no clear absorption features are identified.

If we assume that source #2 is indeed GRB 130327A afterglow, we can
place an upper limit on the GRB redshift of z < 3.9, based on the 
absence of a Lyman-break features.

22696; Schady et al., GCN 22701) with the ESO VLT/X-shooter 
spectrograph, covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA.
The afterglow is clearly detected in the 10s acquisition images taken 
starting at 23:09 UT (~3.7 hours after the GRB trigger) with brightness 
R~19.8 (Vega), calibrated against USNO-B1 stars in the field. 
Spectroscopy started at 23:19 UT on 2018-05-10 (~3.9 hours after the GRB 
trigger) and consisted of 2 exposures of 600 s.

Preliminary analysis of the spectrum reveals continuum flux down to 3600 
AA, which sets an upper limit to the redshift z <~ 2 via the lack of any 
obvious DLA feature. In addition, we identify several absorption lines 
at a common redshift of z=1.305, the most prominent being ZnII/CrII, 
FeII, MgII, and MgI. Moreover, we also identify another absorption 
system at z=0.63 based on the detection of the MgII doublet. Therefore, 
we propose the most probable redshift of the GRB to be z=1.305, with an 
intervening system at 0.638.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
which starts at ~T0-156 s and has a total duration of ~260 s.
The emission is seen up to 0.8 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB180620_T57039/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.19(-0.12,+0.14)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0-0.056 s,
of 1.52(-0.61,+0.72)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum integrated over the most intense
part of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+49.408 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -1.04(-0.31,+0.36)
and Ep = 118(-16,+23) keV (chi2 = 44/57 dof).
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index: beta < -2.7
(chi2 = 44/56 dof).

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
with  alpha = -0.74(-0.33,+0.37)
and Ep = 129(-15,+21) keV (chi2 = 66/57 dof).

TESS observed the location of the optical transient ZTF19abvizsw (Kool et al. 2019, GCN 25616) and associated new X-ray source (Ho et al. 2019, GCN 25658) nearly continuously during Sector 15 from 2019-08-15 to 2019-09-10 in Camera 2, CCD 2.  The location was imaged in nearly 2400 30-minute full-frame images (FFIs) over that period.

A light curve for ZTF19abvizsw was constructed from the FFIs using difference imaging.  First, we constructed a reference image by median stacking 20 FFIs with low background levels.  We then subtracted the reference image from each epoch using the ISIS software (Alard & Lupton 1998; Alard 2000), which solves for a spatially variable kernel that matches the PSF of the reference image to individual FFIs.  This procedure removes systematic errors due to pointing shifts/jitter and thermal variations.  We extracted a light curve by fitting a model of the PSF to the difference images at the predicted location of the transient in the FFIs based on the coordinates of ZTF19abvizsw reported to the Transient Name Server, and subtracted a local background based on the median of pixel values in an annulus of inner/outer radius 8/12 pixels.  Uncertainties were estimated from the photon noise of the source and the observed scatter of the light curve at early times.

We flux-calibrated the differential light curve by shifting the baseline before the transient to zero.  We estimated the 3-sigma TESS limiting magnitude at each epoch by taking a factor of 3 times the flux uncertainty at each epoch and converting to TESS magnitudes (the TESS passband spans 600-1000 nm). The average 3-sigma limiting magnitude during the time of the transient is 19.11 and is dominated by the background flux in each FFI.  

ZTF19abvizsw was seen to brighten above the limiting magnitude in the FFI centered at UT 2019-09-02 03:15 - - one hour before the ZTF measurement at 2019-09-02 04:19:12 (https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2019pim <https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2019pim>) - - and peak at a TESS magnitude of 18.37 +/- 0.18 at in the FFI centered at UT 2019-09-02 04:15.  The discrepancy between this measurement and the ZTF r-band magnitude of 19.45 may be due to the redness of the source (Kool et al. 2019, GCN 25616) or brightness variations within the 30-minute FFI integration.

The light curve has a sharp rise and a slower decline.  The duration (T90) of the transient over the background limit is 1.44 days, and the integrated S/N of the transient was 10.4.  We also fit a fast rise/exponential decay model to the light curve, from which we estimate the rise time to be 1.21 +/- 0.30 hours.  The fit yields a peak magnitude of 18.40 +/- 0.07 at 2019-09-02 04:19:29.  This is in family with the measured early brightness of optical counterparts of GRBs with redshifts near the measured redshift of ZTF19abvizsw of 1.26 (Levan et al. 2019, GCN 25653).

The differenced image is seen at approximately RA=18:37:53.57, Dec=+61:29:55.58, with an estimated error of 3 arcseconds, based on the flux-weighted centroid.  This position is in excellent agreement with the discovery coordinates of ZTF19abvizsw.",1.26,ZTF19abvizsw,TESS,Spectroscopic,1.26

""We have analysed the data XMM-Newton observation of GRB 040827 (Gotz et 
al.
GCN 2670). A preliminary account of these data has been given by
Rodriguez-Pascual & Gonzalez-Riestra (GCN 2688).

The observation started on 2004-08-27 at 18:07:56.UT, lasting 54.3 ks.
Thanks to quick-look data it was soon realised that an afterglow was 
present
but it was more than 1arcmin off the camera boresight. Therefore, the 
telescope
was re-pointed during the observation (causing problems in the generation
of the ancillary file for spectral analysis).

The source intensity profile is consistent within errors with the
instrumental PSF (possible earlier reports of an extended source might be
due to the re-pointing of the satellite).
Astrometry of the XMM-Newton/EPIC images was done by matching X-ray
sources in the field to stars in the USNO-B1 catalogue. The refined
position (J2000) for the X-ray afterglow (source XMMUJ151701.3-160828,
GCN 2678) is: RA(2000) 15h 17m 01.39s, Dec(2000):-16d 08' 28.77''.
The positional accuracy is at a level of 1.5'' (68% c.l.).
This position is consistent with earlier reports (Rodriguez-Pascual &
Gonzalez-Riestra GCN 2688, XMM-2) and with the position of the likely
afterglow established based on optical-NIR data (Berger et al. GCN 2680;
Gladders & Berger GCN 2681; Kaplan & Berger GCN 2683; Tanvir et al. GCN 
2684;
Malesani et al. GCN 2685).

We extracted spectra from the three EPIC cameras. We took the arf file
from the same region of extraction of a different observation.
A single absorbed power law model provides a good description of the data
(chi2_red=1.2 with 187 degrees of freedom), however the column density
(N_H=3.7_{-1.2}^{+4.2}x10^21 cm-2, errors at 90% c.l.) is much larger
than the column density in this direction of the Galaxy (N_H=8x10^20 cm-2,
Dickey & Lockman 1990, or N_H=5x10^20 cm-2 based on Schlegel et al. 1998 
maps).
Fixing the column density to N_H=8x10^20 cm-2 results in a unacceptable fit
with chi2_red=3.0.
We then include an absorption component at the redshift of the afterglow,
keeping fixed the Galactic column density to N_H=8x10^20 cm-2.
The new fit is good (chi2_red=1.0) providing a heavily absorbed 
afterglow with
N_H=1.3_{-0.3}^{+0.6}x10^22 cm-2. The redshift is relatively well 
constrained to
z=0.9_{-0.2}^{+0.9}. The power law photon index is Gamma=2.3+/-0.1 and
the unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux is 3.4x10^{-13} erg cm-2 s-1.

The 0.2-10 keV pn light curve shows a clear decay in time. We excluded from
this analysis the first 4 ks when the XMM-Newton pointing was not 
definitive.
A power law decay with t^{-1.6+/-0.2} can account for the main decay.""

satellite with the Palomar 48 inch telescope equipped with the 47 square
degree Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera. We obtained a series of g-
and r-band images covering 519.3 square degrees beginning at 10:01 UT on
2020 May 14 (0.9 hours after the burst trigger time). This corresponds to
~49% of the probability enclosed in the GRB localization map (GCN 27736).
Each exposure was 300s, reaching a g-band median depth of 21.8 mag and
r-band median depth of 22.0 mag. The images were processed in real-time
through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC (Masci et
al. 2019).

We queried the ZTF alert stream using Kowalski (Duev et al. 2019) and AMPEL
(Nordin et al. 2019). We required at least 2 detections separated by at
least 15 minutes to select against moving objects. Furthermore, we
cross-matched our candidates with the Minor Planet Center to flag known
asteroids, reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018), and apply
machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019). We require no spatially
coincident ZTF alert to be issued before the detection time of the GBM
trigger. The candidates within the 90% probability contour of the GRB
localization map that passed the automatic selection criteria and human

We highlight ZTF20aazpphd, as it is offset 12 arcseconds from the center of
a galaxy at 160 Mpc and was not detected 2.15 days earlier with a limiting
magnitude of g > 20.53. The host spectroscopic redshift is z = 0.04573,
which would imply a g-band absolute magnitude of -17.23.

We examined the latest, enhanced XRT position of the long GRB 200729A detected by Swift (Evans et al., GCN 28165) in PAN-STARRS imaging. We downloaded the Pan-STARRS DR1 images and note the presence of a faint source detected within the XRT error circle (90% confidence Osborne et al., GCN 28168) at:

RA (J2000) = 12:17:30.32
Dec (J2000) = +45:35:41.4

The location of this source is consistent with the pre-burst counterpart detected in Spitzer/IRAC imaging (Laskar et al., GCN 28171).  Using a 1.5 arcsec aperture, we measure that the source has i=21.4+/-0.2 mag, y=21.0+/-0.2 mag, and z=21.0+/-0.1 mag. We note that our z-band photometry is 1 magnitude brighter than the limit reported by NOT (Malesani et al., GCN 28169). The source is not obviously detected in either Pan-STARRS g or r-band imaging. The source may be marginally extended, although it is too faint to definitively determine whether the source is intrinsically extended beyond the PSF of the Pan-STARRS DR1 imaging. 

Based on the column of neutral hydrogen inferred from the Swift/XRT X-ray spectrum (7.1e21 cm-2; https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_unenh_positions/00984929/), the total optical extinction to any counterpart is approximately A_V = 3.7 mag (Guver & Ozel, 2009, MNRAS, 400, 2050).  Assuming the Pan-STARRS source is in NGC 4242 with a TRGB distance of 5.3 Mpc (Sabbi et al. 2018, ApJS, 235, 23), any stellar counterpart would have M_i~-9.3 mag, which is extremely luminous for a star even with initial mass > 25 M_sun.  Thus the lack of an optical or near-infrared counterpart (Hu et al., GCN 28167; Lipunov et al., GCN 28166; Malesani et al., GCN 28169; DAvanzo et al., GCN 28170) and large implied luminosity suggests that a supernova or non-terminal outburst from such a star in NGC 4242 is unlikely.

Alternatively, if the source is a background galaxy, and the i-z color represents a 4000 Angstrom break, this places the redshift of the galaxy at z~1.1, which would provide a natural explanation for the faint XRT flux (GCN 28165), and the lack of detected optical or NIR afterglow.",1.1,GRB 200729A,Swift,Spectroscopic,1.1

We observed the afterglow position (Ambrosi et al., GCN #29289) of the 
bright Swift GRB 210112A (Swift detection: Ambrosi et al., GCN #29289; 
AGILE detection: Ursi et al., GCN #29293; Konus-Wind detection: Svinkin 
et al., GCN #29315) with CAFOS at the 2.2m telescope at Calar Alto, 
Almeria, Spain, in the Ic band. We obtained 10 x 360 s exposures, 
centered at 5.1696 days after the GRB, under good conditions but 
mediocre seeing.

The afterglow (Kann et al., GCNs #29296,29300; Siegel et al., GCN 
#29303) is faintly detected. We measure Ic = 23.69 +/- 0.24 mag. (AB 
mag, vs. a several nearby SDSS stars converted to Ic following the 
Lupton transformations, then transformed back to AB mag).

This magnitude lies slightly above the extrapolation of the decay found 
during the first two epochs (Kann et al., GCN #29300) and may indicate 
an underlying host galaxy. Indeed we also see another faint, possibly 
extended source about 2"" to the East, at RA (J2000) = 14:36:01.453, Dec. 
(J2000) = +33:03:13.40, which may be the host galaxy or a system 
interacting with it. However, the rough redshift estimate of z ~ 2 (Kann

240.9139656,  31.2346451 (J2000)

first detected as part of the ZTF partnership survey.

The source was discovered on JD 2459630.0001 at r=16.59  0.01 mag, which
was 0.98 days after the last non-detection (r>19.34). The transient
position is 2'' from a galaxy in SDSS with a photometric redshift of 0.25 
0.05. Due to the rapid rise of almost 3 magnitudes in one day, and the
possible high luminosity, we triggered follow-up photometry with the
Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) on the 60-inch telescope at
Palomar Observatory (P60). SEDM photometry obtained the night after
discovery established a rapid fade rate of 2.25 magnitudes in 0.88 days as
well as red colors (g-r=0.41  0.08, corrected for Galactic extinction).
The transient was also detected as part of the ZTF public survey that
night, and the rapid fade triggered the ZTFReST pipeline (Andreoni &
Coughlin et al. 2021).

Konus-Wind detected a long-duration GRB at UT 2022-02-19 09:27:25.350 that
is consistent with the position of AT2022cva. The GRB burst time is 2.5
hours before the first ZTF detection. The GRB was also weakly detected by
BAT. The ZTF optical position was outside the coded BAT FoV at the time of
the burst, and the observed counts are consistent with a relatively soft
burst coming from outside the BAT field of view. The Konus-BAT IPN annulus
is consistent with the position of the ZTF transient, and the association
is highly likely.

We conclude that AT2022cva is the likely afterglow to the Konus-Wind GRB.
Given the possible low redshift (z~0.3) continued photometric and
spectroscopic observations are encouraged.

Vergani (GEPI, Obs. de Paris), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow candidate of GRB 240209A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 35343) reported by the GOTO team (Belkin et al. GCN 35715) and also followed-up by the NOT and Wendelstein telescopes (de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN 35716, Busmann et al. GCN 25724) using the T193cm telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France) equipped with the MISTRAL instrument. We took two series of r-band and g-band images (3x10min for each band) starting at 2024-02-14 04:00:34 UT. In both single and combined frames we detect the optical source at a high S/N. We performed forced photometry at the position of the source both on the science and difference image (we used PanSTARRS template images to make the subtraction) as the close HyperLEDA 2722973 galaxy might affect our measure. We derived the following magnitudes :
----------------------------------------------------------
T-T0 (in days, midtime) | mag | filter | subtracted
----------------------------------------------------------
4.893 | 20.06 ± 0.03 mag (AB) | r' | y
4.893 | 19.41 ± 0.02 mag (AB) | r' | n
4.919 | 20.02 ± 0.01 mag (AB) | g' | y
4.919 | 19.78 ± 0.01 mag (AB) | g' | n
-----------------------------------------------
The photometric calibration was performed using nearby stars from the PanSTARRS catalog and magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction and the uncertainties are statistical only.
We note that our residual image magnitudes suggest a fading behavior of the source with respect to the NOT and the Wendelstein r-band epochs while the forced photometry on science images is in very good agreement with them. Further investigations about the potential flux contamination due to the presence of the HyperLEDA 2722973 galaxy will be done.

In addition to our photometric observations, we also performed spectroscopic observations of the source and the HyperLEDA 2722973 galaxy with the blue mode of MISTRAL. A total exposure of 20 minutes was obtained.
The preliminary analysis of the spectrum of the source suggests a rather blue transient (in agreement with the g-r ~ -0.04 we measured  from difference image analysis) but at odds with typical GRB afterglow red colors. Due to the low S/N of the spectrum, we did not identify clear spectral features to estimate a redshift.
The MISTRAL spectrum of the HyperLEDA 2722973 galaxy shows a clear absorption complex that could be identified with the 5175A/5269A lines. This would suggest a redshift of z~0.207, close to the photometric value of z=0.1629+/-0.0150.

Further observation will be taken on Saturday night at OHP (weather permitting) to better characterize the color evolution of this transient.

We acknowledge the excellent support from Observatoire de Haute-Provence, in particular Stéphane Favard for the MISTRAL observations and the SOPHIE observer Magali Deleuil.

3695,2005-07-28 19:27:12.000,"GRB050713: analysis of the XMM-Newton observationAndrea De Luca (IASF Mi) on behalf of a larger collaboraton 
report:

We have analyzed the data from the XMM-Newton observation 
of GRB050713A, discovered by Swift on 2005, July 13 at 
04:29:02.39 UT (Falcone et al., GCN3581).

The XMM-Newton observation started on 2005, July 13 at 
10:18 UT and lasted for 30.7 ks. We report here on the 
analysis of data collected with the EPIC/pn detector, 
which started observing the field at 10:54 UT (~6h 20min 
after the GRB).

As reported by Loiseau et al. (GCN3594), the afterglow of 
GRB050713A is clearly detected in the pn image, at a 
position fully consistent with the refined Swift/XRT one 
(Morris et al., GCN3606). 
Extracting source events from a circle of 25 arcsec radius 
(containing ~80% of the total counts), the time-averaged, 
background-subtracted count rate in the 0.2-8 keV range 
is 0.547+/-0.005 cts/s.

The afterglow is clearly seen to fade along the XMM-Newton 
observation, spanning the time range 23.5-51.5 ks after 
the GRB. The background-subtracted light curve (0.5-5 keV) 
is well fitted (reduced chi2=0.9, 26 d.o.f.) by a power law 
decay with index delta=1.45+/-0.07 (90% c.l.). 
The afterglow decay has significantly steepened with 
respect to the epoch of the earlier Swift observation: 
Morris et al. (GCN 3606) observed an index delta=0.82+/-0.11
in the time range 5-10 ks after the burst using Swift/XRT data. 
This implies the presence of a break in the afterglow X-ray
light curve between 10 ks and 23.5 ks from the GRB.

We extracted the time-averaged spectrum and generated ad-hoc 
response and effective area files. We quote here errors at 
90% level for a single interesting parameter, unless otherwise 
specified.

A fit in the energy range 0.2-8 keV with an absorbed power 
law model yields a reduced chi2 of 1.25 for 172 d.o.f. 
The resulting NH=(3.25+/-0.15)x10^21 cm^-2 is higher than 
the expected Galactic value in the burst direction (NH=1.1x10^21 
cm^-2, Dickey & Lockman, 1990); the best fitting power law photon 
index is Gamma=2.16+/-0.05.
Such results are consistent with the XRT ones (Morris et al., 
GCN 3606), which implies no significant spectral evolution with
respect to the earlier phase of the afterglow.

A better fit to the pn spectrum (reduced chi2=0.97, 171 dof) 
may be obtained fixing the NH to the expected Galactic value 
(NH=1.1x10^21 cm^-2) and adding a neutral, redshifted absorber 
component to the spectral model. With a simple F-test we evaluate 
the chance occurrence probability of the improvement to be 
of 5x10^-11. The best fit value for the intrinsic NH is 4.0x10^21 
cm^-2, while the best fit value for the redshift z is 0.55.
At 90% c.l. for 2 parameters, we obtain the following ranges:
intrinsic NH=(0.4-3.2)x10^22 cm^-2; redshift z=(0.4-2.6).
Using such model, the resulting power law photon index is 
Gamma=2.04+/-0.05.
The observed flux is of 2.2x10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in 0.2-10 keV;
the corresponding unabsorbed flux is of 3.8x10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

As a last step, we divided the pn dataset into two time intervals 
of ~9500 s and ~14600 s (each containing about half of the counts 
from the afterglow) and we repeated the spectral analysis. 
We found no significant spectral changes in the two considered 
intervals.",0.55,GRB050713A,XMM-Newton,Spectroscopic,0.55

report:

We have analyzed the full FREGATE+WXM data for HETE trigger H3934
(GRB051021.56).

The 30-400 keV light curve has two sharp peaks, separated by about 10 s,
superposed on a gentler rise-and-fall. The burst had a T90 duration of 38s
in the 7-40 keV band, and of 27s in the 30-400 keV band.  Emission in the
2-25 keV band appears to continue for at least 90s post-trigger, mostly
below 10 keV.

The integrated spectrum is well-fit by a cutoff power-law function.  The
best-fit parameters are:

alpha = -1.16 --- 90% confidence interval is [-1.25 -1.06]
Epeak = 94.2  --- 90% confidence interval is [76.7 , 111.7]

The 2-30 keV fluence is 3x10^-6 erg/cm2, while the 30-400 keV fluence is 
6 x 10^-6 keV.  Since the ratio S(2-30)/S(30-400) is 0.41, this event is
classified as an X-Ray Rich GRB.

The pseudo-redshift estimated for this burst is pz = 1.4.

We have analysed 4 ks of XRT observations of GRB051111

The refined coordinates for this X-ray afterglow are:

RA(J2000):   23h 12m 33.362s
Dec(J2000):  18d 22' 29.535""

with an estimated uncertainty of 3.5 arcsec (90% containment) and
including the latest XRT boresight correction.
The position is 71 arcsec from the on-board BAT position reported by
Sakamoto et al. and 2.4 arcsec from the optical afterglow first
detected by ROTSE (Rujopakarn  et al., GCN 4247).

The X-ray light-curve is steeply fading with a slope of -1.9+/-0.2.

The spectrum of the PC data can be modelled with an absorbed power-law
with photon index Gamma = 2.2+/-0.3 (90% containment).
There is a slight evidence for an absorbing column higher than the
Galactic value
(5.02e20 cm^-2) at a level of (9+/-5)e21 cm^-2 at the observed redshift
z=1.55 (Hill et al., GCN 4255).

The 0.2-10 keV unabsorbed flux at 5000 s  is 1.8e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1.
At 10000 s the afterglow had faded to flux level of 5.0e-12 erg cm^-2
s^-1.

W. Hogg (NYU), and Michael R. Blanton (NYU) report on behalf of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Collaboration:

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaged the field of burst
GRB051215 prior to the burst.  As these data should be useful
as a pre-burst comparison and for calibrating photometry, we are
supplying the images and photometry measurements for this GRB field
to the community.

Data from the SDSS, including 5 FITS images, 3 JPGS, and
3 files of photometry and astrometry, are being placed at
http://mizar.as.arizona.edu/~grb/public/GRB051215

We supply FITS images in each of the 5 SDSS bands of a 8'x8' region
centered on the GRB position (ra=163.139 (10:52:33.4), dec=38.6260
(38:37:33.6); GCN 4352), as well as 3 gri color-composite JPGs (with
different stretches). The units in the FITS images are nanomaggies
per pixel.  A pixel is 0.396 arcsec on a side. A nanomaggie is
a flux-density unit equal to 10^-9 of a magnitude 0 source or,
to the extent that SDSS is an AB system, 3.631e-6 Jy.  The FITS
images have WCS astrometric information.

In the file GRB051215_sdss.calstar.dat, we report photometry
and astrometry of 179 bright stars (r<20.5) within 15' of the
burst location.  The magnitudes presented in this file are asinh
magnitudes as are standard in the SDSS (Lupton 1999, AJ, 118,
1406). Beware that some of these stars are not well-detected in
the u-band; use the errors and object flags to monitor data quality.

In the files GRB051215_sdss.objects_flux.dat and
GRB051215_sdss.objects_magnitudes.dat, we report photometry
of 1240 objects detected within 6' of the GRB position.
We have removed saturated objects and objects with model
magnitudes fainter than 23.0 in the r-band.  The fluxes listed
in GRB051215_sdss.objects_flux.dat are in nanomaggies while the
magnitudes listed in GRB051215_sdss.objects_magnitudes.dat are
asinh magnitudes.

All quantities reported are standard SDSS photometry, meaning that
they are very close to AB zeropoints and magnitudes are quoted
in asinh magnitudes.  Photometric zeropoints are known to about
2% rms.  None of the photometry is corrected for dust extinction.
The Schlegel, Finkbeiner, and Davis (1998) predictions for this
region are A_U=0.081 mag, A_g=0.059 mag, A_r = 0.043 mag, A_i=0.033
mag, and A_z=0.023 mag.

The file GRB051215_sdss.spectro.dat contains a list of the 8 objects
with SDSS spectroscopy within 6 arcminutes of the GRB position.
In addition to the redshift and 1-sigma error for each object,
this file also lists the object spectroscopic classification.

Among the spectra, there are 4 galaxies at the same redshift z=0.145.
Most likely, this is the redshift of the cluster noted in Ofek and Gal-Yam
(GCN 4351).  This value is somewhat higher than photometric redshift
estimate of z=0.09 in Gal et al. (2003, AJ, 125, 2064), although there
are also 2 galaxies near that redshift.

SDSS astrometry is generally better than 0.1 arcsecond per
coordinate.  Users requiring high precision astrometry should take
note that the SDSS astrometric system can differ from other systems
such as those used in other notices; we have not checked the offsets
in this region.

See the SDSS DR4 documentation for more details:
http://www.sdss.org/dr4

These data have been reduced using a slightly different pipeline
than that used for SDSS public data releases.  We cannot guarantee
that the values here will exactly match those in the data release
in which these data are included.  In particular, we expect the
photometric calibrations to differ by of order 0.01 mag.

collaboration reports:

We have analyzed the data from the XMM-Newton observation
of GRB051016, discovered by Swift on 2005, October 16 at
05:23:31 UT (Boyd et al., GCN4096).

The XMM-Newton observation started on 2005, October 16 at
13:44 UT and lasted for 29.4 ks. 

As reported by Loiseau and Perez-Martinez (GCN4101), the afterglow of
GRB051016 is clearly detected in the EPIC images and
its position is fully consistent with the refined Swift/XRT one
(Morris et al., GCN3606).

Extracting source events from a circle of 25 arcsec radius
(containing ~80% of the total counts), the time-averaged,
background-subtracted count rate in the 0.5-8 keV range
is 0.028+/-0.001 cts/s, 0.0092+/-0.0006 cts/s and 0.0100+/-0.0006
cts/s in the pn, MOS1 and MOS2 cameras, respectively.

The afterglow is seen to fade along the XMM-Newton
observation, spanning the time range 30.0-59.4 ks after
the GRB. The pn background-subtracted light curve (0.5-8 keV)
is well fitted (reduced chi2=1.0, 7 d.o.f.) by a power law 
decay with index delta=0.9+/-0.3 (90% c.l.). 
The observed afterglow decay is consistent with the XRT
results (Beardmore et al., GCN4100).

We extracted the time-averaged spectra and generated ad-hoc
response and effective area files for the pn, MOS1 and MOS2 
cameras. The spectra were fitted simultaneously.
Unless otherwise specified, we quote errors at 90% level for 
a single interesting parameter.

A fit in the energy range 0.5-8 keV with an absorbed power 
law model yields an unacceptable reduced chi2 of 2.5 for 26 d.o.f.,
The resulting NH=(3.0+/-0.2)x10^21 cm^-2 is somewhat higher than 
the expected Galactic value in the burst direction (NH=1.1x10^21
cm^-2, Dickey & Lockman, 1990); the best fitting power law photon 
index is Gamma=2.6+/-0.3.

A better fit may be obtained fixing the NH to the Galactic 
value and adding a redshifted neutral absorber. This yields a
reduced chi2 of 1.74 for 25 d.o.f. The intrinsic gas column 
density and the redshift are not well constrained owing to their
strong correlation. The best fit values are: intrinsic 
NH=6.7x10^22 cm^-2, z=4.1. At 90% confidence level for 2 parameters,
the intrinsic NH is larger than 5x10^21 cm^-2 and the redshift 
is larger than 0.8. The best fit value of the power law photon index 
is Gamma=2.5+/-0.2. The observed flux (0.5-8 keV) is of 7.6x10^-14
erg cm^-2 s^-1, corresponding to an unabsorbed flux of
1.1x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.",4.1,GRB051016,XMM-Newton,Spectroscopic,4.1

D. Q. Lamb (Chicago), M. Nysewander (UNC), F. Hearty (Colorado), H.-W.
Chen (Chicago), and D. E. Reichart (UNC) report on behalf of the FUN GRB
Collaboration:


We have further analyzed the Ks-band images taken with the ARC 3.5-meter
telescope using NIC-FPS, beginning 1.6 hours after the burst, and the
Ks-band images taken with the SOAR 4.1-meter telescope using OSIRIS,
beginning 24 hours after the burst.

From the ARC image, we measure a limiting magnitude of Ks = 19.5 (3
sigma) and a magnitude of Ks = 17.78  0.13 mag for the source that is
in the XRT error circle and in the DSS (Price et al., GCN 4854), using
six 2MASS objects (five of ""A"" quality and one of ""C"" quality;
Skrutskie et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 1163) in the NIC-FPS image for
calibration and an aperture radius of 1.6 arcsec, as dictated by a
curve of growth analysis of the source.  The magnitude of Ks = 18.3 
0.1 originally reported by Chen et al. (GCN 4861) corresponded to an 
aperture radius of 1.0 arcsec, and is therefore fainter.

From the SOAR image, we measure a limiting magnitude of Ks = 18.4 (3
sigma) and a magnitude of Ks = 17.53  0.20 for the source, using the
four 2MASS objects (one of ""A"" quality and three of ""C"" quality) in 
the OSIRIS image for calibration and an aperture radius of 1.6 arcsec,
as dictated by a curve of growth analysis of the source.  This result
is consistent with that reported by Nysewander et al. (GCN 4857).

The two results are consistent with a constant brightness source, and
PSF-matched image subtraction provides no indication that the source
brightened between the two epochs.

The source appears to be marginally extended in the ARC image, and may
be the host galaxy (Price et al., GCN 4854).  Spectroscopy of the source
is therefore encouraged.  However, even if the source is the host
galaxy, or a chance-coincidence foreground star (~1% probability),
PSF-matched image subtraction of the Ks-band images does not detect the
afterglow at 1.6 hours after the burst to the limiting magnitude [Ks =
18.4 (3 sigma)] of the SOAR image.

If one assumes minimal extinction in the Ks-band and extrapolates the
unabsorbed X-ray flux (Page et al., GCN 4850) to 1.6 hours after the
burst, the resulting Ks-band to X-ray spectral index is shallower than
-0.48 (3 sigma), using the limiting magnitude of the SOAR image (which
is appropriate if the location of the burst is coincident with the
faint source in the XRT error circle), and shallower than -0.36 (3
sigma), using the limiting magnitude of the ARC image (which is
appropriate if the location of the burst is not coincident with the
faint source in the XRT error circle).  This suggests one or more of
the following possibilities:

1. The redshift of the burst is greater than z ~ 17, which is highly
unlikely.

2.  The cooling break is blueward of the Ks-band at 1.6 hours after the
burst.  Given that the X-ray temporal index is ~-0.6 (Page et al., GCN
4850), the Ks-band to X-ray spectral index would be ~-0.7 (e.g., Sari,
Piran, and Narayan 1998, ApJ, 497, L17) if the cooling break were
instead redward of the Ks band.

3. The afterglow is highly extinguished.  Given that the source-frame
N_H ~ 4 x 1021 cm^-2 (1+z)2.6 (Page et al., GCN 4850; Morrison and
McCammon 1983, ApJ, 270, 119), a redshift of only z ~ 1 is needed in
order to produce 3 - 4 mag of extinction in the observer-frame Ks-band,
provided that dust destruction by the burst and/or its afterglow is
minimal.  Furthermore, a redshift of z ~ 1 yields source-frame values of
N_H that are consistent with giant molecular cloud environments.

Finally, we point out that the properties of the afterglow of this
burst are reminiscent of those of GRB 051022 (Doty et al., GCN 4145;
Butler et al., GCNs 4165 and 4170).",z ~ 1,GRB 060306,SOAR,Photometric,1.0

ground-calculated position is (RA,Dec) = 239.215, 78.597 deg
{15h 56m 51.6s, 78d 35' 48.7""} (J2000) +- 1.9 arcmin,
(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 96%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a very long period of emission extending
from T+ ~25 sec to T+ ~330 sec.  There are numerous (6-10) overlapping peaks
in the light curve, with the two brightest peaks at T+ ~140 sec
and T+ ~290 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 276 +- 10 sec (estimated error
including systematics). This stretched-out emission is consistent
with this burst being at high redshift (z=4.9, Price, GCN 5104).
We  have only fragmentary event data after T+423 sec, but the onboard
mask-tagged light curves show no significant emission after this time.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-16.3 sec to T+326.1 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.   The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.76 +- 0.08. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
4.2 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+136.24 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

Given a redshift of z=4.9, we compute Eiso to be 2.04 X 10^53 ergs

J. S. Bloom, D. Perley, D. Kocevski, N. Butler (UC Berkeley), J. X.  
Prochaska (UCO/Lick), and H.-W. Chen report:

On 31 May 2006 UT, using Keck I (+LRIS), we obtained spectra of a  
bright red extended source (""G*""; RA, DEC J2000 = 18:35:45.7,  
+52:37:37) that is 11.2 arcsec South of the southern edge of the  
revised XRT error circle (Troja et al. GCN 5093). Strong absorption  
features, which we identify as Ca II H+K, indicate a redshift for  
this early type galaxy of z=0.287. Weak [OII] emission can be seen  
indicating some low level of active star formation.

We advance the hypothesis that this galaxy is the host of short burst  
GRB 060502B (Troja et al. GCN 5055) based on several points:

      1. The galaxy is a massive early-type similar to the putative  
hosts of 050509B [1] and 050724 [2].

      2. The redshift inferred of the hosts of 050509b (z=0.225) and  
050724 (z=0.258) are remarkably similar to that of G* indicating  
comparable energetics of the respective bursts.

      3. At the redshift of z=0.287, the burst location would be  
between 47 - 67 kpc in projection from the center of the putative  
host, similar to the offset (39 +/- 13 kpc) inferred for 050509b.  
There are viable progenitors scenarios (e.g. degenerate binary  
mergers) where bursts occur at such distances from their birthsite.

      4. Weak X-ray afterglow and no detected optical afterglow would  
seem to indicate a low density circumburst environment, as would be  
expected if the GRB originated far from the progenitor birthsite.

We recognize the difficulty of now confirming this hypothesis but  
note that in the striking similarity of the host, redshift,  
afterglow, and offset configuration to GRB 050509b, these  
observations and inferences have a priori precedent.""

We have analyzed the XRT PC mode data for GRB060807 (De Pasquale et al. 2006;
GCN5409), also analyzed carefully by Page et al. (2006; GCN5423).  We find 
identical spectral parameters (within errors) for the absorbed powerlaw model.
However, we note that the fit goodness for the data in the 0.3-10 keV band from 
0.1-250 ksec after the BAT trigger is marginal (chi^2/nu=138.8/103), rejectable 
at 99% confidence.

The spectrum exhibits rare (see, e.g., Butler 2006, astro-ph/0604083, for a 
few additional possible cases) and narrow modulations about the best fit 
model.  We can fit these modulations with 3 unresolved emission lines (giving 
a delta_chi^2 fit improvement of 39.0, for 6 additional degrees of freedom).  
We estimate a significance for the 3 line set of 5.0 sigma, including a 
decrease in the estimated significance due to the search for lines at many 
possible centroid energies in the 0.3-5.0 keV band.  Plots of the spectrum 
with and without the 3 most significant lines can be found at:

http://astro.berkeley.edu/~nat/GRB060807/xrt_060807_nolines.jpg , and
http://astro.berkeley.edu/~nat/GRB060807/xrt_060807_lines.jpg .

The centroid energies of the lines are 0.73, 0.90, and 1.24 keV, 
with uncertainties ~0.05 keV.  The brightest line at 0.73 keV has a flux 
~5 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for the time period 0.1-250 ksec after the
BAT trigger, or 3% of the 0.3-10 keV afterglow flux.

Allowing associations for the lines with K-alpha transitions in H- or He-like 
species of common light metals or any ionization state in the Fe group 
elements, the 3-line set allows several redshift solutions.  The highest 
probability peaks have dz/z~0.2 and occur at z=0.4, 1.0, 1.6, and 4.5.  
The large X-ray absorbing column (e.g., GCN5423) suggests that the source is 
not at high-z.  An optical spectrum of the host galaxy or optical transient
could resolve the redshift degeneracy and would provide important insight 
into the nature of the X-ray emission.","0.4, 1.0, 1.6, and 4.5",GRB060807,NASA,Spectroscopic,

on behalf of a larger collaboration report:

We have analyzed the data from the XMM-Newton observation of
GRB060729, discovered by Swift on 2006, Jul 29, 19:12:29 UT
(Grupe et al., GCN5365).

The XMM-Newton observation started on 2006, July 30 07:59 UT
and lasted for ~61 ks. A high particle background level affects
only mildly the whole observation and only the highest flares
have been cut out, in consideration also of the source strength.

The background subtracted pn light curve (0.3-10 keV) shows a
clear decay from about 5 c/s at the beginning of the observation
down to 2 c/s. The light curve can be fit with a power law decay
with index delta=1.04+/-0.02 but with a large chi2=1.8 (58 dof).
This is due to a large bump in the middle of the exposure. Adding
a Gaussian we obtain a better chi2=0.7 (55 dof). The central time
is 69+/-1 ks (90% confidence) from the burst start and the
(Gaussian) width over the time is about 7+/-2%. We note also that
the time of the XMM-Newton observation is close to the break time
observed by Swift XRT in the GRB060729 light curve (Grupe, GCN5432).
Fitting a broken power law to we obtain a first decay index
delta1=0.85+/-0.05, which is inconsistent with the early slope of
0.34 reported by Grupe.

We extracted time-averaged spectra from the EPIC pn camera (since
in the initial part of the MOS observation the GRB spectrum should
be mildly piled-up) and the two RGS spectrometers (first and second
order) and we generated ad-hoc response files.
A simultaneous fit with an absorbed power law model with Galactic
and intrinsic (at a redshift of z=0.54, Thoene et al. GCN5373)
yields a reduced chi2 of 1.05 (1824 dof, without any systematic
error). The resulting NH=(3.9+/-0.9)x1020 cm-2 (consistent with
the Galactic value of NH=4.8x1020 cm-2, Dickey & Lockman 1990)
and a relatively low NH_host=(9.2+/-0.4)x1020 cm-2. The best
fitting power law photon index is Gamma=2.09+/-0.01.
The RGS spectrometers do now show any clear evidence of absorption
or emission lines in the 0.3-2 keV energy range.
The observed flux is of 9.5x10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 in 0.3-10 keV;
the corresponding unabsorbed flux is of 1.2x10-11 erg cm-2 s-1.

""We have imaged the Swift XRT localization region for GRB060923A
(Trigger 230662; Stamatikos et al., GCN 5583) with Keck-I + LRIS
(I-band) and Gemini-North + NIRI (J- and K-band).  We identify the
candidate afterglow of Tanvir et al. (GCN 5587) in our K-band images
as the only point source consistent with the XRT localization, with a
brightness estimated as follows:

   K-band:  Ks~20.6 mag at 07:04 UT

We estimate its brightness (without correcting for Galactic
extinction) by reference to the 2MASS star at R.A. 16:58:31.463,
Dec. +12:22:12.88 (J2000), which has J=15.175 mag, H=14.585 mag, and
Ks=14.457 mag in that catalog.

The position of the source by reference to NOMAD catalog sources in
the vicinity is:

    R.A. 16:58:28.15, Dec. +12:21:38.9 (J2000)

with an estimated uncertainty of less than 0.5"" in each coordinate.

The source is undetected in our earlier J-band and I-band images.  Our
upper limits on the brightness of the source in these bands are:

   I-band:  I>23.5 mag at 06:11 UT
   J-band:  J>23.7 mag at 06:42 UT

The I-band photometry is referenced to the SDSS imaging of this field
(Cool et al., GCN 5585) while the J-band zero-point is derived from
the 2MASS star referenced above.  Magnitudes have not been corrected
for Galactic extinction.

If this source is the afterglow of GRB060923A, the red colors are
suggestive of a highly extinguished or high-redshift burst.  In
particular, correcting for the Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998)
estimate of E(B-V)=0.058 mag Galactic extinction, and assuming a
temporal decay of t^(-1) and an intrinsic afterglow spectrum of F_nu ~
nu^(-1), these limits indicate suppression of the afterglow flux
(relative to K-band) by a factor of >18 at 0.9 micron (I-band) and by
a factor of >14 at 1.23 micron (J-band).",0.671,GRB060923A,"Keck-I + LRIS, Gemini-North + NIRI",Spectroscopic,0.671

Leicester/INAF-IASFPa) and D. Morris (PSU)  report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed the first 2 orbits (up to 8ks after the trigger) of
Swift-XRT data obtained for GRB 061121 (Page et al., GCN Circ. 5823).
Using ~3.2ks of Photon Counting (PC)  data, we derive a refined position
of

RA(J2000) =   09 48 54.54
Dec(J2000) = -13 11 42.4

with an estimated error radius of 3.5 arcsec (90% confidence, using the
updated teldef file as described by Burrows et al. in GCN Circ. 5750).  
This is 4.0 and 0.7 arcsec from the original XRT and UVOT positions (GCN
Circ. 5823) respectively.

Because the BAT triggered on a pre-cursor, XRT was on target for the main
burst. The detected emission peaked at ~74s after the trigger, at a count
rate of ~2400 count s^-1 (corrected for pile-up). After 200s, the decay
follows a slope of alpha_1 = 0.36 +/- 0.07, until about 3ks after the
trigger, when the decay steepens to alpha_2 = 1.4 +/- 0.4.

The Windowed Timing mode data between 200 and 600s after the trigger
(i.e., when the data are clearly no longer piled-up) can be fitted with a
photon index of 2.25 +/- 0.12, with a total absorbing column of 2.3e21
cm^-2; comparison with the PC data from orbit 2 shows no further spectral
evolution. This absorption is significantly in excess of the Galactic
value of 5.1e20 cm^-2. Taking the redshift to be 1.314 from the Keck
measurement (GCN Circ. 5826; Bloom, Perley & Chen), the excess NH is
equivalent to a value of 9.6e21 cm^-2 in the rest-frame of the burst. The
observed (unabsorbed) flux for this spectrum is 2.51e-10 (3.81e-10) erg
cm^-2 s^-1.

If the decay continues with a slope of alpha = 1.4, the estimated count
rate at 24 hours is 0.031 count s^-1. This corresponds to an observed
(unabsorbed) flux of 1.19e-12 (1.80e-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

State), H. Swan (U Mich), R. Quimby (Caltech), report on behalf of the
ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB
071025 (Swift trigger 295301, GCN 6986, Pagani, et al.) and detected
an optical counterpart as reported in GCN 6987 (Rykoff, et al.).  We
have improved the photometry and recalibrated the images relative to
USNO-B1.0 R-band, which is significantly offset from the magnitudes in
USNO-A2.0 R-band.

 From our initial observations at T+80.3s we see the counterpart rise
to a peak of 17.3+/-0.2 at T+332s (midtime for a 40s coadd), and then
fade slowly over the next 1500 s.  At T+595s (midtime for a 280s
coadd) the magnitude is 17.6+/-0.1.  This integration is nearly
simultaneous with the NIR detections of H~13.8 (Covino, et al., GCN
6988) and J=14.95 (Bloom, et al., GCN 6989).

Although the ROTSE-III images are calibrated relative to R-band, the
unfiltered CCD has significant sensitivity redward of R.  Our
observations are thus consistent with a possible R-band dropout (Im,
et al., GCN 6991) and UVOT non-detection (Pangani, et al., GCN 6986).

We can assume that the intrinsic GRB spectrum as an R-J color of ~1,
and the reddening is entirely caused by the intergalactic medium
(IGM).  We then use the ROTSE-III magnitude and the integrated
ROTSE-III response curve convolved with the IGM absorption model of
Meiksin (2005) to estimate an upper limit on the burst redshift of
z~5.3 (for more details see Ruiz-Velasco, et al, 2007).  We note that
at this redshift the R-band offset would be ~1.2 mag, which may be
consistent with the limits of Im, et al.  However, if the reddening is
not caused by absorption in the IGM then the burst redshift may be
lower.",z~5.3,GRB 071025,ROTSE-IIIb,Photometric,5.3

We observed the field of GRB 080523 (Stroh et al., GCN 7767) with the 
ESO VLT equipped with FORS2. Photometric observations were conducted on 
2008 May 24, between 8:14 and 8:27 UT (about 10.9 hr after the GRB). 
Inside the revised XRT error circle (Osborne et al., GCN 7768), we 
detect a faint source at coordinates (J2000):

RA = 01:23:11.61
Dec = -64:01:51.8

Lacking any information on variability, we cannot assess whether this

The optical/NIR source inside the XRT errorcircle, previously reported

Preliminary photometry yields the following r' band magnitudes,

The quoted error is statistical only. There is an additional 
systematic error in the absolute calibration using the GROND zeropoint 
which is expected to be in the 0.2 mag range. As the GROND photometric 
system is based on the SDSS in g'r'i'z' these values are AB magnitudes.

The complete light curve obtained during the first night post burst 
can be reasonably well described with a power law of index 1.1 +- 0.2.

A broad band SED from g' to K was constructed using data obtained 
simultaneously at a midtime of 1500 s after the trigger. After 
correcting for a Galactic foreground extinction corresponding to a 
reddening of E_(B-V)= 0.16 (Schlegel et al. 1998), the r' to K band 
SED is well described with a power law of spectral index beta = 0.85 
+- 0.15.

We tentatively associate the large, foreground extinction corrected 
g'-r' color of around 1.4 mag with Ly-alpha absorption in the host at 
a redshift of 3.8 +- 0.4. This photometric redshift estimate has been 
obtained using hyperZ (Bolzonella et al. 2000). We caution, however, 
that this might be subject to changes due to a future improved 
calibration.",3.8 +- 0.4,GRB 081228,GROND,Photometric,3.8

both on the observation of sky features and a fit to the instrument 
sensitivity.

We detect in the spectrum flux at wavelengths lambda>1.1 microns, and a 
flux compatible with zero below that limit. Interpreting this wavelength 
as the onset of Lyman alpha absorption in the IGM, this leads us to 
deduce a value of z~8.1.

We have also analysed all the available photometry (GCNs 9200, 9201,
