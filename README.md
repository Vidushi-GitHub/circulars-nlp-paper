# Large Language Model Driven Analysis of General Coordinates Network (GCN) Circulars

This work explores the large language models (LLMs) to reliably separate astrophysical events and extract structured information from the unstructured GCN Circulars. With more than 40,500 Circulars accumulated over three decades, manual extraction of key values such as redshift or observed wavebands is less feasible.<br>
We show that LLMs, combined with neural topic modeling, contrastive fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation, can classify observations by messenger and waveband, and automatically extract information such as GRB redshifts with high accuracy.

Beyond proof of concept, this work contributes to:<br> 
(A) Classification of GCN types and their tables <br>  
(B) Redshift tables from GCNs <br> 
(C) Open-source release of all codes
